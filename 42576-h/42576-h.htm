<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>There are few books on the American spiders, and these
are either large and expensive works or else special papers
published by scientific societies, and so little known to the
public. Since publishing my papers on the New England and
Canadian spiders in the <i>Transactions of the Connecticut Academy</i>
from 1882 to 1894, I have had frequent calls for a smaller
and simpler book to meet the wants of readers who, without
making a special study of the subject, want to know a little
about spiders in general and especially those species that they
often meet with. It is hoped this book will answer the purpose
and help to lessen the prejudice against spiders, and lead
to a more general acquaintance with them, like the popular
knowledge of birds and butterflies. The characters used in
the descriptions are, as far as possible, those that can be seen
without microscopic examination and without much experience
in the handling of small animals. The illustrations, which show
the form and markings of every species, are from my own
drawings and photographs, a large part of them made new
for this book.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>This book is designed to make the reader acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
the common spiders most likely to be found over a large part
of the United States as far south as Georgia and as far west as
the Rocky Mountains. Local collections show that in the
neighborhood of any city in the country there are at least three
or four hundred species of spiders; but few such collections
have been made, and it is not yet possible to tell all the
kinds of spiders that live in any particular place, or how far
any species extends over the country. The species which
are here described and figured are all of them well known and
have been described in other books. Rare and doubtful species
are omitted, though some of these may in time prove to be among
the most common. A large number of spiders are too small to
be easily seen, and most of these are omitted, only a few representative
species being described. Spiders have, unfortunately,
no common names, except such indefinite ones as "the garden
spider," "the black spider," "the jumping spider," and the
like. Even "tarantula" has become only a nickname for
any large spider. The names of spiders, like those of other
animals, have been given to them independently by different
persons, so that many of them have more than one name, and
the more common the spider the larger the number of names.
In this book only one name is usually given to each species, and
the name used is one that has been published with a description
of the species in some other well-known book. Readers
who are interested in the names of species and in comparing
the classifications of different naturalists are referred to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
"Catalogue of the Described Arane&aelig; Of Temperate North
America," by George Marx, in the <i>Proceedings of the United
States National Museum</i>, 1890, which is a useful index to what
has been published on American spiders.</p>

<p>The front half of a spider's body, called the cephalothorax,
contains in one piece the head and thorax, the only outward
division between them being shallow grooves from the middle
of the back to the front legs. In the middle of the cephalothorax
is usually a groove or depression, under which, inside,
is a muscle that moves the sucking apparatus by which food is
drawn into the mouth. At the sides of the thoracic part are
four pairs of legs, and on the head part are a pair of palpi
and a pair of mandibles. The legs have seven joints: (1) the
coxa, the thick basal joint, having little motion; (2) the trochanter,
a short joint moving very freely on the end of the
coxa; (3) the femur, the largest joint of the leg, moving with
the trochanter in all directions; (4) the patella, moving up and
down on the end of the femur; (5) the tibia, joined closely to
the patella and moving with it up and down; (6) the metatarsus;
and (7) the tarsus, moving together on the end of the
tibia. The palpi are like small legs and have one less joint
than the walking legs. The mandibles are close together at
the front of the head <a href="#f001-2.png">(fig. 2)</a>. They are two-jointed, the basal
joint stout and the end joint or claw slender and sharp-pointed.
The claw has near its point a small hole, which is the outlet
of the poison gland. The poison kills or disables the insects
which are captured by the spider. Its effect on the human
skin varies in different persons; sometimes it has no effect at
all; oftener it causes some soreness and itching like the stings
of mosquitoes and bees, and cases have been known in which it
caused serious inflammation which lasted a long time. Spiders
seldom bite, and only in defense, the bites so commonly charged
to them being often the work of other animals.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

</div>



<p>On the front of the head are the eyes, usually eight in
number, differing in size and arrangement according to the
kind of spider. The sight of spiders is distinct for only short
distances. Spiders of middle size can see each other, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
insects which they eat, at a distance of four or five inches, but
beyond that do not seem to see anything clearly. At the ends
of the feet are two claws, curved and with teeth along the inner
edge, and in many spiders there is a third shorter claw between
them <a href="#f210-2.png">(fig. 212)</a>. The claws are sometimes surrounded by a
brush of flattened hairs (figs. <a href="#f101-4.png">104</a>, <a href="#f114-6.png">114</a>). The basal joints of the
palpi are flattened and have their inner edges extended forward
so that they can be used as jaws to press or chew the food.
These are called the maxill&aelig;. Between the maxill&aelig; is a small
piece called the labium, and between the legs is a larger oval
piece called the sternum.</p>

<p>The hinder half of the body, the abdomen, is connected with
the cephalothorax by a narrow stem <a href="#f001-2.png">(fig. 1)</a>. It has at the
hinder end the spinnerets, three pairs of appendages having
at their ends a great number of microscopic tubes through
which the thread is drawn out. When not in use the spinnerets
are folded together, so that the smaller inner pair are
concealed.</p>

<p>The thread of spiders resembles that spun by caterpillars in
making their cocoons, and can be manufactured in the same
way into silk cloth. The spider's thread is composed of a great
number of finer threads passing from the body through separate
tubes and uniting into one before they have time to dry. This
can be seen by examining the attachments of spiders' threads
to glass. All the spinning tubes are not alike, but on certain
parts of the spinnerets are larger or differently shaped tubes,
and these are the outlets of glands of different kinds in the
spider's abdomen, and are used in making different kinds of
threads for certain parts of the webs, nests, or cocoons.</p>

<p>In front of the spinnerets on the under side is a small
opening to the trache&aelig;, or air-tubes <a href="#f001-2.png">(fig. 1)</a>. At the front
of the abdomen on the under side is a transverse fold of the
skin, at the ends of which are the openings of the air-sacs or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
lungs, and between them the opening of the reproductive
organs <a href="#f001-2.png">(fig. 1)</a>. The latter is covered in females by an apparatus,
sometimes large and complicated, called the epigynum.
Its presence shows that the female is full grown. Young
spiders do not have it. Male spiders have the ends of the palpi
enlarged, and under the terminal joint what is known as the
palpal organ, sometimes very complicated in shape. The presence
of these organs shows that the male is full grown.
Young males that have nearly reached maturity have the ends
of the palpi simply enlarged. Male spiders almost always have
the body smaller and the legs longer than females of the same
species.</p>

<p>The colors of spiders are partly in the skin itself and partly
in the hairs and scales that cover it. Almost all spiders are
covered with hair of some kind, but in some species it is so
fine and short that it has little effect on the color. In others
the skin is entirely covered with hairs of various lengths and
sometimes with scales somewhat like those of butterflies, flattened
and feathered or toothed on the edges. The colors of
spiders are very varied, and in many species, especially of the
jumping spiders, as brilliant as those of butterflies. The most
common colors are grays and browns, resembling the ground
or plants and stones among which the spiders live. Sometimes
the color is uniform all over the body, except that it is a little
darker toward the head and the ends of the feet. The most
common marking is a spot on the front of the abdomen over
the spider's heart, sometimes merely a translucent part of the
skin and sometimes a definite color spot darker in the middle
and outlined with a lighter shade or white. The hinder half
of the abdomen is often marked with several pairs of spots,
becoming smaller toward the end, and these spots may be
united into a pair of stripes or a more complicated pattern.
(See figures.) The legs are often marked with rings of color,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
almost always at the ends of the joints. Besides these common
markings there are in some spiders strong contrasts of color,
such as bright red or yellow spots on a black ground. In the
males, especially among the Attid&aelig;, there are often shining
scales that reflect different colors in a bright light, and tufts of
black or white hairs about the head and front legs.</p>

<p>Spiders live in all kinds of places. Certain species are
attached to houses and seldom found far from them, and many
of these occur over a large part of the world. The light webs
in the corners of rooms are chiefly the work of <i>Theridium
tepidariorum</i> (p. <a href="#Page_112">112</a>), occasionally of <i>Steatoda borealis</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>) and <i>Steatoda triangulosa</i> (p. <a href="#Page_121">121</a>). In cellars the thin webs
about the stairs and shelves are those of the long-legged
<i>Pholcus phalangioides</i> (p. <a href="#Page_129">129</a>) or of <i>Linyphia nebulosa</i> or <i>minuta</i>
(pp. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>, <a href="#Page_145">145</a>), and the thick flat webs in corners and between
the beams are those of <i>Tegenaria derhamii</i> (p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>). On the outside
of houses live two jumping spiders, the most common being
<i>Epiblemum scenicum</i> (p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>), a small gray species the color of
weathered wood, and the other, <i>Marptusa familiaris</i> (p. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>).
Some of the round-web spiders live in great numbers about
houses. The three brown species, <i>Epeira sclopetaria</i> (p. <a href="#Page_160">160</a>),
<i>patagiata</i>, and <i>strix</i>, hide in cracks and at night make their
round webs in porches, barns, and bridges. In the northern
part of the country <i>Epeira cinerea</i> (p. <a href="#Page_165">165</a>) has the same habit.
<i>Epeira globosa</i> (p. <a href="#Page_174">174</a>) is often found on the outside of houses,
and so are <i>Zilla atrica</i> and <i>Zilla x-notata</i> (p. <a href="#Page_185">185</a>). <i>Amaurobius
ferox</i> (p. <a href="#Page_215">215</a>), a large imported species, is sometimes found
in cellars, and several Dictyna (p. <a href="#Page_206">206</a>) live in great numbers
on the outside of houses, in corners of windows, under the
edges of shingles, or in cracks of walls, spreading their webs
wherever there is room for them and gathering dust so that
they often make a distinct spot on the wall. In the southern
states <i>Filistata hibernalis</i> (p. <a href="#Page_220">220</a>) is one of the most common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
spiders about houses. Its webs often make a round spot of
dust a foot or more in diameter. Stones and sticks lying on
the ground furnish shelter for a great number of spiders.
<i>Steatoda borealis</i> (p. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>), <i>marmorata</i> (p. <a href="#Page_121">121</a>), and <i>guttata</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_120">120</a>) and <i>Asagena americana</i> (p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>) are found in such
places, and so, especially in the South, is <i>Latrodectus mactans</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>). The large jumping spiders, <i>Phidippus mystaceus</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_50">50</a>) and <i>tripunctatus</i> (p. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>), make large nests of white
silk under stones near the ground. The ground spiders,
<i>Drassus saccatus</i> (p. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>), <i>Gnaphosa conspersa</i> (p. <a href="#Page_2">2</a>), and <i>Prosthesima
atra</i> (p. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>), run on the ground and hide under stones.
<i>Lycosa nidicola</i> (p. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>), <i>Lycosa communis</i> (p. <a href="#Page_75">75</a>), <i>Lycosa pratensis</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>), <i>polita</i> (p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>), and <i>cinerea</i> (p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>) are often found
under shelters of this kind. The crab spiders of the genus
Xysticus live under stones, but oftener under bark farther
from the ground.</p>

<p>In the summer, plants of all kinds from grass to trees are full
of spiders. The Lycosas (pp. <a href="#Page_68">68 to 84</a>)run among the short
grass. The small species of Linyphia (p. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>) and Erigone
(p. <a href="#Page_148">148</a>) make their flat webs close to the ground among small
plants. <i>Linyphia marginata</i>, <i>communis</i>, <i>coccinea</i>, and <i>phrygiana</i>
make theirs among plants and rocks, a foot or two above the
ground. The Theridiums (p. <a href="#Page_110">110</a>) live between leaves and on
the ends of twigs, covering them with webs that only show
when the dew is on them. <i>Agalena n&aelig;via</i> (pp. <a href="#Page_91">91 to 95</a>) makes
its flat webs on the grass and anywhere else where it can find a
place to fasten them. The jumping spiders (p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>) run about
for their prey on plants, and some of them have silk nests
among the leaves. The Misumenas (p. <a href="#Page_25">25</a>) live among flowers
and wait for insects to alight within reach. The webs of
Dictyna (p. <a href="#Page_206">206</a>) are commonest on the ends of grass and
twigs, and are known by the dust that they gather. The
round-web spiders mature in the middle of the summer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
then <i>Epeira trivittata</i> (p. <a href="#Page_166">166</a>) is found on all kinds of bushes
and grass, and later <i>Epeira insularis</i> (p. <a href="#Page_169">169</a>) and <i>Epeira trifolium</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_171">171</a>) in hidden nests near their webs. <i>Epeira angulata</i>,
<i>sylvatica</i>, and <i>nordmanni</i> (p. <a href="#Page_162">162</a>) live among bushes and
trees. <i>Cyclosa conica</i> (p. <a href="#Page_183">183</a>), <i>Acrosoma spinea</i> (p. <a href="#Page_190">190</a>), and
Uloborus (p. <a href="#Page_216">216</a>) live among low bushes in openings of the
woods. Hyptiotes (p. <a href="#Page_218">218</a>) lives among the lower dead branches
of pines, perching on the end of a twig which it exactly matches
in color.</p>

<p>The marshes are the home of great numbers of spiders. The
Tetragnathas (p. <a href="#Page_198">198</a>) live there, especially along the streams
and ditches. <i>Epeira gibberosa</i> (p. <a href="#Page_175">175</a>) and <i>placida</i> (p. <a href="#Page_176">176</a>) make
their horizontal and oblique webs among the tall grass in open
places. The two species of Argiope (pp. <a href="#Page_193">193 to 198</a>) swarm in
marshes and open fields and in autumn become conspicuous by
their size and bright colors, and when they disappear leave over
winter their brown cocoons (pp. <a href="#Page_197">197</a>, <a href="#Page_200">200</a>) fastened to the grass.</p>

<p>The moss and dead leaves in the woods are alive with
spiders; even in summer some species always live there, and
in winter the young of those that in warm weather live among
the bushes find shelter where they can remain torpid through
the cold season without freezing.</p>

<p>The eggs of spiders are covered with silk, forming a cocoon
which varies much in shape and color in different species.
Some spiders hang it in the web, others attach it to plants or
stones, and others carry it about with them either in the mandibles
or attached behind to the spinnerets. The young remain
in the cocoon until they are able to run about, and after coming
out of the cocoon keep together for a short time, sometimes
in a web which they make in common, sometimes in a nest
made by the mother, and in some species on the mother's
back, but they soon scatter and hunt their own food or make
cobwebs, according to the habits of the species.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span></p>

<p>Different kinds of spiders mature and breed at different
times of the year, most of them living only one season. Those
that mature late, like <i>Agalena n&aelig;via</i> and Argiope, pass the
winter as eggs, while those that mature early, like <i>Epeira
sclopetaria</i> and <i>Lycosa nidicola</i>, pass the winter half grown.
Some species, like <i>Theridium tepidariorum</i> (p. <a href="#Page_112">112</a>), breed several
times in the year, and old and young are found at all
seasons.</p>

<p>The spiders are naturally divided into two groups of families:
(1) the hunting spiders, which run on the ground or on plants,
catching insects wherever they find them, or waiting among
leaves and flowers until insects come within their reach;
(2) the cobweb spiders, which make webs to catch insects and
live all the time in the web or in a nest near it.</p>

<p>The hunting spiders include: (1) the Dysderid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>), a
few species with six eyes only and with four breathing holes at
the front end of the abdomen; (2) the Drassid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_1">1</a>), or
ground spiders, which live among stones and dead leaves or
among plants, making tubular nests and flat egg cocoons but
no cobwebs; (3) the Thomisid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>), the flat and crab-like
spiders living on plants or under bark and stones; (4) the
Attid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>), the jumping spiders, with wide heads and
large front eyes, many of them brightly colored and active in
their habits; (5) the Lycosid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>), the long-legged running
spiders, living on the ground and, a few of them, in holes
and carrying about their round egg cocoons attached to the
spinnerets.</p>

<p>The cobweb spiders include: (1) the Agalenid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>, making
flat webs on grass or in corners of houses, with a tube at
one side in which the spider lives; (2) the Theridid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_107">107</a>),
round spiders with flat or irregular webs in corners and on
plants; (3) the Linyphiad&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>), with flat webs, small
spiders of a great number of species living near the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
and in shady places; (4) the Epeirid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>), the round web
spiders; (5) the Cribellata, having a calamistrum (see p. <a href="#Page_205">205</a>)
on the hind legs and making rough webs that gather dust.</p>

<p>Cobwebs are of four principal kinds:</p>

<p>1. The flat webs, closely woven of long threads crossed by
finer ones in all directions and connected with a tubular nest
where the spider hides, and from which it runs out on the
upper side of the web after insects that may fall upon it.
These are made by Agalena and Tegenaria (pp. <a href="#Page_91">91 to 104</a>).</p>

<p>2. The net-like webs, made of smooth threads in large
meshes, sometimes in a flat or curved sheet held out by threads
in all directions. The spider lives on the under side, back
downward. These are made by Theridid&aelig; and Linyphiad&aelig;
(pp. <a href="#Page_107">107</a>, <a href="#Page_134">134</a>).</p>

<p>3. The round webs, made of threads radiating from a common
center and crossed by circular loops and spirals, part of which
are adhesive.</p>

<p>4. The webs of the Ciniflonid&aelig;, composed in part of loose
bands of silk (p. <a href="#Page_205">205</a>).</p>

<p>The simplest and best way to preserve spiders for examination
is to put them in alcohol. It kills them immediately and
keeps their form and markings and, to a great extent, their
colors. They may be kept alive for a few days in glass bottles
or jars. It is not necessary to make holes in the covers, or to
feed the spiders often. They need water, and this can be furnished
them conveniently by putting a piece of wet paper or
rag in the bottle.</p>

<p>If one wishes to find what spiders live in his neighborhood,
they must be looked for at all times and in all kinds of places.
The house and cellar should be looked over and the spiders
watched until they are fully grown. The outside of the house
and fences should be looked over occasionally in the same way,
only those spiders being taken that are full grown, unless they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
are of new or rare kinds. A great many spiders may be found
on the garden fences of a shady street, especially in the early
summer and again in the autumn. At both seasons they are
more active in the middle of the day and more likely then
to be wandering about. The writer always carries two small
bottles, one a common homeopathic medicine vial, holding one
or two drams and half full of alcohol, the other a straight tube
vial, without any neck and about the same size, that is kept
always dry and occasionally wiped out to remove the threads
that are made in it. The dry bottle is placed quickly over the
spider and moved about until the spider is coaxed to go into it.
The bottle is then turned up and closed with a finger until the
other bottle can be uncorked and the spider shaken into the
alcohol. In the fields and along the country roads the stones
and sticks that have been lying for some time on the ground
should be carefully lifted and searched, both on the under surface
and on the ground below. The stones and sticks should
be turned back into the same places so that other spiders
may find at once comfortable places to hide under. If they
are dropped on new ground, it may be a year before they
are fit to use again. Among trees and shrubs the best
things are to be found by moving slowly about and watching
for spiders, nests, and cobwebs without disturbing them. The
webs can be best seen when moving toward the light. The
greatest number of spiders can usually be found along paths
and the edges of woods, and paths through the woods are the
best places for many ground spiders.</p>

<p>Spiders should be looked for in the same way in grass, by
creeping along on the ground or by sitting down and watching
until something walks into view; or the grass and weeds may
be swept with a cotton bag, fastened on a hoop like a dip net,
with a short handle, and the spiders picked out with a dry
bottle from among the leaves and insects that will be gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
with them. Bushes may be swept in the same way, or may be
shaken over an open umbrella, or a piece of cloth or paper. In
winter, when spiders are torpid, great numbers can be found
by sifting the dead leaves that have been lying for some years
in the woods. A common coal sieve is fine enough to hold the
leaves while the spiders and sticks and dirt pass through, and
may be picked over on a cloth or carried home in a bag and
examined in the house. The sifting should be repeated several
times, as many of the spiders hold to threads among the leaves
and become loosened only after much shaking.</p>

<p>In the following pages a general description is given of each
family, followed by descriptions of the species belonging to it,
with a figure of each species placed as near as possible to the
description. In some cases, where the genera are large and
well defined, separate descriptions are given of each genus, but
where the genus is not easy to distinguish or represented by
only a few species, there is no separate generic description, and
the species are placed next to those of other genera to which
they are most closely related. If the names of spiders are
known, they can readily be found by the index at the end of
the book. If information is sought about an unknown spider,
the illustrations through the book furnish the most convenient
index, as the general form and proportions of spiders and the
arrangement of their eyes usually show to what family they
belong. The ground spiders and those without cobwebs are
described first, and the sedentary species living in webs in the
last half of the book. Readers unfamiliar with the subject are
advised to read first the descriptions of the families and compare
with them the spiders that they find in their own neighborhoods.
The figures are in most cases enlarged for the sake
of distinctness, and spiders of much smaller size must be
looked for.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span></p>




<p class="center" style="font-size: 200%;"><b>THE COMMON SPIDERS</b></p>

<h2>THE DRASSID&AElig;</h2>


<p>The Drassid&aelig;, like the Lycosid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>), are ground spiders,
though some genera, like Anyph&aelig;na (p. <a href="#Page_12">12</a>) and Clubiona
(p. <a href="#Page_15">15</a>), are equally common in summer on bushes. They
make nests in the form of a bag or flattened tube, but no
cobwebs for catching insects, and are commonly found running
about among dead leaves and short grass and sometimes even
on bare ground and sand. In form they are usually two or
three times as long as they are wide, like the Lycosid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>),
but more often flattened on the back. The legs differ but
little in length, and the first and second pairs are directed forward,
the third and fourth backward. Their hairs and spines
are short, giving them a smooth, velvet-like appearance. The
feet have two claws, with a brush of flattened hairs under
them, like the Thomisid&aelig; and Attid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>), but unlike the
Lycosid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>), which have three claws. The mandibles are
large and strong and are together as wide as the head. The
eyes are all about the same size and arranged in two rows
of about the same length and not far apart, but between different
species there are slight differences in their arrangement.
The colors are usually dull gray, brown, and black, with few
markings or none. A few species are very brightly marked,
as in Micaria (p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>) and P&oelig;ilochroa (p. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>).</p>

<p>There are three groups among the Drassid&aelig;:</p>

<p>1. Prosthesima, Gnaphosa, P&oelig;cilochroa, Pythonissa, and
Drassus, which are generally dark in color and flattened above,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
with the cephalothorax narrow in front and the eyes covering
about half the width of the head and differing in their relative
positions among the different genera. The labium is long and
the maxill&aelig; slightly widened at the end, or with the outer
corners rounded off and sometimes a crease or depression in the middle.
The joints of the first legs are sometimes
thickened in the middle. The
lower spinnerets are longer than the
others and flat on the end.</p>

<p>2. Micaria, Geotrecha, Phrurolithus,
Agr&oelig;ca, and Anyph&aelig;na, in which the
body is less flattened, the legs longer, and
the movements quicker. The colors are
lighter and more varied. The labium is
short and the maxill&aelig; with straight sides.</p>

<p>3. Clubiona, Chiracanthium, and
Trachelas, in which the colors are plain
and light, the eyes spread over more than
half the front of the head and close
to its front edge. The labium is as
long as it is in Drassus, but contracted
at the base. The maxill&aelig;
are narrow in the middle and flat
and wide at the ends.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Gnaphosa conspersa.</b>&mdash;Half an inch
long and rusty black in color. In
alcohol the legs and cephalothorax
are dark reddish brown and the abdomen gray. The whole
body is covered with fine black hairs. The cephalothorax and
abdomen are about the same size and a little flattened. The
legs are stout and all nearly the same length. The upper row
of eyes is nearly straight and the lateral eyes much farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
from the middle pair than these are from each other <a href="#f003-5.png">(fig. 3)</a>.
The middle eyes are oval and oblique, diverging toward the
front. The maxill&aelig; are large, and rounded on the outer
corners. The mandibles are large and strong, with a wide,
flat, serrated tooth <a href="#f003-5.png">(fig. 5)</a> under the claw. The cocoon is
white and flat, with a diameter as great as the length of the
spider. The female, as far as I have observed,
makes no nest, but partly lines with silk a shallow
hole, in which she nurses her cocoon.
It lives under stones and leaves as far
north as the White Mountains and west to the
Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, and on
the Pacific coast in Oregon. A smaller and
similar species, <i>Gnaphosa brumalis</i>,
lives on the top of Mount Washington
and as far north as Labrador.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Pythonissa imbecilla.</b>&mdash;About quarter of an
inch long, bright orange brown on the
cephalothorax and legs and blue black on
the abdomen, with a few white hairs around
the muscular spots. The legs are covered
with fine long hairs a little darker in color
than the skin. The cephalothorax is wide
behind and more narrowed in front than in
Gnaphosa. The eyes <a href="#f006-8.png">(fig. 6)</a> are close together,
and the lateral eyes of both rows are larger
than the middle pairs and a little farther back
on the head. The maxill&aelig; <a href="#f006-8.png">(fig. 8)</a> are short
and wide, and bent toward each other so that they nearly meet
in front of the labium. The front edges are nearly straight and
the outer corners only slightly rounded. The sternum is wide
and almost circular. The tarsus of the female palpi tapers
from the base to the tip.</p>

<p><b>P&oelig;cilochroa variegata.</b>&mdash;This is one of the most brightly
colored of the family. The cephalothorax is bright orange,
a little darker toward the eyes. The
abdomen is black, with three transverse
white stripes and a T-shaped
white mark between the first and
second stripes. On the front of
the abdomen the white stripes are
sometimes tinged with orange. The
femora of the first and second legs
are black. The distal end of the
femur and both ends of the tibia of the fourth
legs are black. Other parts of the legs are
orange-colored. The female is quarter of an
inch long. The cephalothorax is narrower than
in <i>Prosthesima atra</i> and <i>Gnaphosa conspersa</i>,
and the sternum longer and narrower. The
maxill&aelig; <a href="#f009-1.png">(fig. 10)</a> are long and widened at the
outer corners. The two rows of eyes <a href="#f009-1.png">(fig. 9)</a>

Cephalothorax and abdomen both white at
the sides and in the middle, with two black
stripes from the eyes nearly to the spinnerets.
The abdomen is covered with long
hairs, black in the stripes and silvery white
in the light portions. The legs are gray,
with white hairs. The under side is light
gray, with two black stripes at the sides of
the abdomen that do not quite reach the
spinnerets. The spinnerets are unusually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
long. The eyes are arranged as in <i>variegata</i>, the middle
eyes being even more distinctly farther apart than they are

<p><b>Prosthesima atra.</b>&mdash;Black, and
less than a third of an inch long.
It may be mistaken for a small
<i>Gnaphosa conspersa</i>, but, besides
the small size, the abdomen is
usually longer in proportion and
the head is narrower than in
Gnaphosa. The color is usually
a deeper black and less likely to be gray in
the young and rusty in the old, but the feet and
under side of the abdomen are sometimes yellowish
in the young. The eyes <a href="#f014-6.png">(fig. 14)</a> are closer
together and the two rows more nearly of the
same length. In alcohol the cephalothorax
and legs are blacker than in Gnaphosa and less
brown. The maxill&aelig; <a href="#f014-6.png">(fig. 15)</a> are a little longer
and less rounded at the outer corners than in
Gnaphosa or Pythonissa. The mandibles <a href="#f014-6.png">(fig. 15)</a>
are without the large teeth under the claw that
Gnaphosa and Pythonissa have, and they
are turned forward more than in those
genera. It lives on the ground and under
stones. The cocoon is white or pink,
attached by the under surface, with the
upper side convex and thickened in
the middle, sometimes with a little dirt
attached to it.</p>

dull black and, like the cephalothorax, turn
brown in alcohol. The abdomen is black,
with a bright white stripe in the middle
that extends from the front end about two-thirds
its length; and at the hinder end, just
over the spinnerets, is another white mark
<a href="#f017-8.png">(fig. 17)</a>. The under side of the abdomen

sides. The labium is as wide as it is long,
narrowed toward the end but truncated at
the tip. The color is light gray, with short
fine hairs all over the body. The front of the head, the feet,
and the mandibles and maxill&aelig; are darker and browner. The
abdomen is marked only with the usual four muscular spots
and sometimes a few transverse dark markings toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
hinder end. The legs are long and tapering in both sexes.
The male is smaller and more slender than the female, and
the male palpi are long, with the end very little enlarged.
They live under stones, and make a large transparent bag of
silk in which the female makes her cocoon of
eggs, and stays with it until the young come
out. Early in the summer a male and
female often live together in the nest, even
before the female is mature.</p>

<p><b>Geotrecha crocata.</b>&mdash;Black, with the
ends of the legs light yellow and a
bright red spot on the end of the
abdomen. It is about a third of an
inch long. The legs are slender and
the body is not at all flattened. The
cephalothorax is two-thirds as wide as long,
oval behind and narrowed in front of the
legs, where the sides of the head are
nearly parallel. The abdomen is oval and
nearly twice as long as wide. The spinnerets
are so far under the body that they show but
little from above. At the front end of the
abdomen is a spot larger below than above,
where the skin is thicker and harder and
browner in color than the rest. The cephalothorax
is dark brown or black, as are also
the femora of all the legs and of the palpi.
The ends of the third and fourth legs are a
lighter brown and the ends of the first and second legs and
palpi light yellow. The abdomen is deep black except a bright
red spot at the hinder end, which varies in size, is sometimes
broken into several spots, or is sometimes wanting altogether.
The eyes <a href="#f020-2.png">(fig. 20)</a> are near together, the upper row curved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
down at the ends. The maxill&aelig; are straight, with the sides
nearly parallel, and the labium is shorter than wide. The
males are usually smaller than the females and have the red
spot larger. These spiders live among stones in dry open
places. They are easily alarmed and move very rapidly. The
flat, parchment-like cocoons found on stones are probably made
by this species.</p>

<a href="#f023-4.png">(fig. 23)</a>. The cephalothorax is a little narrower behind than
it is in <i>crocata</i>. Its color varies from
orange to dark brown. The femora of
all the legs are striped lengthwise with
brown and yellow. The hind legs are
brown, with a little yellow on the upper
side of the patella and tibia. The other
legs are yellow, sometimes with brown
stripes on the under side. The white

cephalothorax is twice as long as wide, and only a little widened
in the middle. It is highest in the middle, curving downward
at both ends. The front row of eyes <a href="#f025-8.png">(fig. 25)</a> is nearly straight
and the upper row curved, with the middle eyes highest and
the eyes all farther apart than in the lower row. The abdomen
is one-half longer than the cephalothorax and about as
wide, blunt at both ends and drawn in a little at the sides and
above at a point a third of its length from the front. The
legs are long and slender, the fourth pair longest. The colors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
are light yellow brown, with gray hairs and scales which on
the abdomen have green and red metallic reflections. The
legs are darker from before backward,
the front pair all light yellow except
the femur, and the third and fourth
pairs with longitudinal brown stripes
that nearly cover the tarsal joints. The
abdomen has a pair of transverse white
stripes near the constricted part and
another pair less distinct at the front
end. The under side is as dark as the
upper. The white markings extend underneath
halfway to the middle line. The maxill&aelig; are nearly
straight on the outer edge and a little widened
toward each other at the ends. The labium is
narrowed at the end and a little longer than
wide <a href="#f025-8.png">(fig. 26)</a>.</p>

<p>There is an orange-colored Micaria from Long
Island, N.Y., and farther south (probably what is
described by Hentz under the name <i>Herpyllus
auratus</i>), that seems to belong to this species
<a href="#f025-8.png">(fig. 27)</a>. Its size and markings are the same, and
the epigynum is like that of <i>longipes</i>. The cephalothorax,
abdomen, and femora of all the legs are
bright orange color, with brilliant yellow and
green reflections. The spinnerets are
black, and there are five or six transverse
black marks on the hinder half of the
abdomen and some irregular black spots
around the white bands.</p>

The cephalothorax is nearly as wide behind as it is long. The
head is about half as wide as the thorax. The eyes <a href="#f029-2.png">(fig. 30)</a>
are large for so small a spider, and cover more than half
the width of the head. The
middle eyes of the upper
row are oval and turned obliquely,
diverging toward the
front. The labium is short
and the maxill&aelig; straight, as
in Agr&oelig;ca and Anyph&aelig;na,
but wider at the base <a href="#f029-2.png">(fig. 32)</a>.
The legs are long and slender,
except the tibia and metatarsus of the
first and second pairs, which are twice as
thick as the same joints of the other legs
and have on the under side two rows of
strong spines <a href="#f029-2.png">(fig. 29)</a>. The cephalothorax
is light yellowish, with a black line on the
edge each side, and two light gray stripes.
The abdomen is gray, with transverse white
markings that vary greatly in size and shape
in different individuals. The abdomen is
covered with scales that change from grayish
green to pink with the motions of the spider.
The legs are pale, except the patella and
tibia of the first pair, which are black or
dark gray, with the tip of the tibia white.
The tibia and patella of the second pair are
marked with lighter gray in the same way.
It lives among stones in open ground, and
runs short distances with great swiftness.
When still it lies close to a stone, with the

<p><b>Agr&oelig;ca pratensis.</b>&mdash;A little light-colored spider, resembling
the next species, <i>Anyph&aelig;na incerta</i>. It is about a fifth of an inch
long. The cephalothorax is wide behind and low in front and
highest near the dorsal groove. The head is contracted in
front of the legs more than it is in
<i>incerta</i>. The front row of eyes is
nearly straight, the middle pair only
a little the higher <a href="#f033-6.png">(fig. 33)</a>. The upper row
is longer and more curved, with all the eyes
about the same distance apart, the middle
pair not so much separated as in <i>incerta</i>.
The abdomen is widest behind, but not as
wide as in <i>incerta</i>. The spinnerets are two-jointed,
as in Anyph&aelig;na. The legs are long,
the fourth pair longest, and are a little thicker
than those of <i>incerta</i>. The cox&aelig; of the hind
legs almost touch, and the sternum is short
and nearly round <a href="#f033-6.png">(fig. 36)</a>. The labium is
short and the maxill&aelig; straight, as in Anyph&aelig;na.
The cephalothorax, legs, and mouth
parts are light brownish yellow. The cephalothorax
has a fine dark line on each side and
two broken longitudinal stripes made up of
gray marks radiating from the dorsal groove.
The abdomen has two rows of gray oblique
markings on a light ground. The general
appearance is like a small Lycosa. It lives
among leaves and short grass. There is
little difference between male and female.</p>

<p><b>Anyph&aelig;na incerta.</b>&mdash;About a fifth of an inch long, light yellow,
with gray markings. The cephalothorax is three-quarters as
wide as long, rounded at the sides and highest in the middle.
The front of the head is very low, so that the eyes nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
touch the mandibles. The front row of eyes is nearly straight.
The upper row is longer and more curved, with the middle eyes
highest and farthest apart <a href="#f037-1.png">(fig. 39)</a>.
The abdomen is large in the female,
widest behind the middle, and a little
pointed behind. The labium is not
longer than wide, and the maxill&aelig; are
straight, with the sides parallel. The
sternum is oval, not so short and wide
as in <i>pratensis</i>. The opening of the
air-tubes is halfway between the epigynum
and spinnerets <a href="#f037-1.png">(fig. 38)</a>, instead of
just in front of the spinnerets, as it is in
most spiders. The spinnerets are two-jointed.
The legs are slender and tapering, the fourth
longest in females and the first in males. The
cephalothorax has two longitudinal broken
gray bands. The abdomen has a double row
of spots in the middle and oblique rows of
smaller spots each side. The oblique lines
of spots extend under the abdomen halfway
to the middle.</p>

<p><b>Anyph&aelig;na calcarata.</b>&mdash;The same size and
color as <i>A. incerta</i>, with longer legs. The
markings are the same in both species.
The plainest difference between the females
is in the epigynum, the hard and dark parts
of which are larger and longer in <i>incerta</i>.
Another slight difference is in the shape
of the sternum, which in <i>calcarata</i> extends
farther between the hind legs <a href="#f042-3.png">(fig. 42)</a>. In
<i>incerta</i> it is more pointed at the hinder end
and shorter <a href="#f037-1.png">(fig. 38)</a>. The difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the length of the legs in the
two species, which is slight
in the females, is greater in
the males, the legs of <i>calcarata</i>
being the longer. The
palpi of the males differ considerably.
In <i>incerta</i> <a href="#f037-1.png">(fig.37)</a> the tibia of the palpus
has a large process on the
outer side close to the tarsus and extending
along its edge a third of its length. In
<i>calcarata</i> <a href="#f042-3.png">(fig. 43)</a> the corresponding process
is small and does not lap over the tarsus.
The cox&aelig; of the third and fourth legs of
the male <i>calcarata</i> have little processes on
the under side <a href="#f042-3.png">(fig. 42)</a>, one on the fourth
and two on the third. These do not occur

The body is an eighth to a sixth of an inch
long. The abdomen is oval, two-thirds as
wide as long, and nearly as high as it

as wide as long, widest across
the dorsal groove and narrowing gradually
to half as wide in front. The
eyes of the upper row are twice as
large as those of the front row. The
first legs are longest in both sexes,
measuring in the female over twice
the length of the body and in the
males three times. The spines are
very long on the legs and palpi but
only a little darker in color. The
general color is pale yellow or white,
with two broken gray stripes on the cephalothorax
and two middle and several lateral
rows of light gray spots on the abdomen.
The spinnerets are slender and two-jointed. The opening of
the air-tubes is halfway between the spinnerets and the
epigynum. The palpi of the male <a href="#f046-7.png">(fig. 47)</a> are long and
slender, and the tibia is slightly curved and has a large thin
process on the outer side.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE GENUS CLUBIONA</h3>

<p>These spiders are all pale and most of them without markings.
The eyes are close to the front edge of the head and
cover more than half its width (figs. <a href="#f049-2.png">50</a>, <a href="#f053-4.png">54</a>,
<a href="#f055-7.png">56</a>). The upper
row is longer and the eyes larger and the middle pair farthest
apart. The distance between
this pair varies according to the
species. In <i>crassipalpis</i> and
<i>canadensis</i> it is little more than
that between the middle and
lateral eyes, while in <i>rubra</i> it
is nearly twice as great. The
mandibles of the females are
swelled at the base in front,
and this swelling is greatest in
<i>canadensis</i> <a href="#f055-7.png">(fig. 55)</a>. The mandibles
of the males are longer
and are shaped in a variety of
ways according to the species.
The shape of the epigynum is
indistinct and variable, and females
of different species are
difficult to distinguish. The
females of <i>ornata</i> and <i>excepta</i>
are known by their markings
and those of <i>rubra</i> by their size
and resemblance to the male.
The females of <i>crassipalpis</i> and <i>tibialis</i> are doubtful. The palpal
organs and male palpi are of great variety and distinguish the
males of all species without much difficulty.</p>

plants in summer and under bark and stones at all seasons.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Clubiona crassipalpis.</b>&mdash;A quarter of an inch long and pale,
without markings. The head is sometimes a little darker than
the rest of the body, and the mandibles
and ends of the male palpi
are always darker. The eyes of the
upper row are almost equidistant,
the middle pair only a little farther
apart than they are from the lateral
eyes. The mandibles of the male
(figs. <a href="#f049-2.png">49, 50</a>) are elongated as usual,
narrowed toward the end, and thickened in
front just above the middle.
On the outer side
in front is a sharp ridge
that extends from the
base of the claw halfway
up the mandible. The
inner edges of the mandibles
are thin and inclined
backward toward
the mouth, but there is
no line or ridge between
the thick and thin portions
as in some other
species. The palpi of the
male <a href="#f049-2.png">(fig. 51)</a> have the
patella and tibia both
short. The tibia is widened
on the outer side
and laps over the tarsus,
extending in a blunt hook for half its length.</p>

are sharply hollowed out with a ridge
between the thick outer and thin inner
portions. The male palpi <a href="#f053-4.png">(fig. 53)</a> have
the patella about as long as wide, as it
is in <i>crassipalpis</i> and <i>canadensis</i>, but the
tibia is very large, with a hook in the
usual place on the outer side and a
much larger process, which extends forward over
the tarsus. The tarsus is long and thickened
in the middle where it rests against the process
of the tibia.</p>

than long, with two processes on the outer side. The upper
tibial process is a simple point extending along the outer side
of the tarsus for a quarter of its length. The under process is
twice as long, with a projecting corner at its base and running
forward to a sharp point, with a round notch halfway between
the point and base. The female has the head wider and the
mandibles very much swelled in front at the base <a href="#f055-7.png">(fig. 55)</a>.

are but little swelled in front, not much
more than those of the male, and the male
mandibles <a href="#f058-9.png">(fig. 58)</a> are only a little narrowed
at the ends. The male palpi <a href="#f058-9.png">(fig. 59)</a>
have the tibia very much widened on the
outer side, with a short tooth in the middle
and two larger short processes on the outer
side. The palpal organ has a large dark-colored

<p><b>Clubiona ornata.</b>&mdash;This is one of the few
Clubionas that have markings on the abdomen.
The general color is pale as usual,
but the abdomen has a dark stripe in the middle, broken into

oblique dark and light transverse markings. These marks are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of different sizes in different individuals and connected in
different ways. The length is from a third to half an inch.
The abdomen is wide across the middle and more pointed behind
than in most species. The front middle eyes are about as far
apart as in <i>tibialis</i> and nearer than in <i>rubra</i>. The mandibles
are not much swelled in front. The legs of the male are longer
than those of the female, with the first
pair longest, while in the female the
fourth pair is longest. The male mandibles
<a href="#f060-2.png">(fig. 62)</a> are narrow at the end and
hollowed on the inner edges as in <i>tibialis</i>,
with a sharp ridge between the thick
and the thin portions. The male palpi

as wide as the thorax and as
high in the middle halfway between
the eyes and the dorsal

The first pair of legs are thicker than
the others and as long as the fourth.
The second pair are also somewhat
thickened. The legs are orange
brown, darkest on the front pair. The cephalothorax
is dark brown and finely roughened over the
whole surface, without hairs except in front. The abdomen is
pale, with no markings except over the dorsal vessel and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>

<p><b>Chiracanthium viride.</b>&mdash;This has the color and general appearance
of the Clubionas, but the legs are longer and the first legs
are considerably longer than the fourth. The body is shorter
and the abdomen is wider and thicker in the middle. The

but the sternum is shorter and rounder. The head is but little
narrowed and the eyes cover almost its whole width. The
upper spinnerets are longer than the lower and distinctly two-jointed.
The spines of the legs are small and inconspicuous.
The color in life is greenish white, the mandibles brown, and
the stripe over the dorsal vessel darker than the rest of the
abdomen.</p>

<p>The male has the front legs nearly three times as long as the
body, though the other legs are not much longer than in the
female. The mandibles are also elongated, as in the males of
Clubiona. The male palpi have the tarsus long, with a pointed

<h2>THE DYSDERID&AElig;</h2>


<p>The Dysderid&aelig; are a small family of spiders resembling in
their general appearance the Drassid&aelig;, but differing from them
in several important characters. They have only
six eyes instead of the usual eight, and they have
four breathing holes in the front of the abdomen,
two of them leading to the usual lungs and the
others to the air-tubes, which in most
spiders open just in front of the spinnerets.</p>

skin around the base of the legs
is thick and hard, so that the sternum appears to extend between
them <a href="#f070-2.png">(fig. 72)</a>. There are two tracheal openings just behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the openings of the lungs. The cephalothorax and legs are
orange brown, darker toward the front. The abdomen is the
same color, but so pale as to be almost white.</p>

darker toward the front. The abdomen is
purplish brown, darker in the middle and
toward the front. In the male the head is
more narrowed and the front legs longer.
The front metatarsi are curved at the base
and have a tooth each side, the inner one
farthest from the tibia. The palpal organ is outside the tarsal
joint, as it is in the Mygales.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE THOMISID&AElig;</h2>


<p>The Thomisid&aelig; are generally flat, short, and widened behind,
and have a sidewise gait and crab-like appearance. The first and
second legs are often much larger than the third and fourth,
and all the legs extend sidewise from the thorax and not forward
and backward, as they do in the Drassid&aelig; (pp. <a href="#Page_1">1-21</a>). The
feet have two claws and a thick brush of hairs. They are generally
smooth or covered with very short and fine hair, and often
have coarser hairs scattered at considerable distances from each
other over the back. The eyes are small and in two slightly
curved rows, the upper one longest and often much longer than
the front row. The mandibles are small and narrowed toward
the end. The maxill&aelig; are narrow at the end and slant inward.
Most of the species belong to the three following genera:</p>

<p>Xysticus (p. <a href="#Page_30">30</a>) is flat, with short legs, and marked with gray
and brown, like bark and stones.</p>

<p>Misumena (p. <a href="#Page_25">25</a>) is white or brightly colored. The first and
second legs are much longer than the third and fourth, and
there is great difference between the sexes, the females being
large and light colored, while the males are small, and yellow
or green, with red and brown markings.</p>

<p>Philodromus (p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>) is generally small, with long slender
legs, the second pair longest. The colors are generally light
gray and brown, sometimes with iridescent scales.</p>

<p>Besides the larger genera are several other spiders belonging
to this family. <i>Tmarus caudatus</i> (p. <a href="#Page_38">38</a>) resembles Philodromus
in color and outline, but has besides the caudate abdomen
a very different head and thorax, and the hind legs much shorter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
than the first and second. <i>Ebo latithorax</i> (p. <a href="#Page_38">38</a>) is a small Philodromus,
with a wide body and exaggerated second legs. <i>Thanatus
lycosoides</i> (p. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>) is like a stout Philodromus, with rough hairs
and markings, resembling some Lycosid&aelig;. <i>Tibellus duttonii</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>) is a long straw-colored spider, resembling Philodromus
in its feet and head, but having a long slender abdomen, with
two black spots.</p>

</div>

<p>The Misumenas are the most conspicuous spiders of their
family, and are among the few that are popularly noticed.
They grow to a large size and are white or brightly colored,
and live in open places
on flowers. The males
and females differ widely.
The males mature early
and remain small, and are
marked with a variety of
colors in spots and bands,
while the females grow
several times as large,
lose in great part their
markings, and become
white or yellow. In both
sexes the two front pairs
of legs are much longer
than the two hinder pairs,
and often differently colored.
In the young the
colors are variable and there is less difference between the
sexes. The Misumenas live on plants, among the flowers,
especially on large flat clusters, like those of carrot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
thoroughwort. They stand among the flowers, holding by the
hind legs, with the front legs extended or bent in stiff and
awkward positions, and wait for insects to alight on the flowers
within their reach. Whether spiders prefer flowers colored
like themselves is an unsettled question; at any rate, Misumenas
of all colors and both sexes have been found on white
flowers. Occasionally individuals are
found on flowers of exactly the same
color as themselves; for
example, deep yellow <i>M.
aleatoria</i> on the wild indigo,
<i>Baptisia tinctoria</i>, and the
reddish <i>M. asperata</i> on the
flowers of sorrel, <i>Rumex
acetosella</i>. The adult females
of <i>vatia</i> and <i>aleatoria</i>
are easily mistaken for
each other. Both vary in
color from white to deep
yellow, and grow to a large
size, but they can be distinguished
by the difference
in the shape of the
head. <i>Asperata</i> is perhaps
the most common species.
The female seldom grows as large as the others, and does
not lose entirely the red markings of the abdomen and legs.
The scattered stiff hairs also distinguish it from the others.
The males of the different species are distinct enough one
from the other, though they differ widely from the females. The
shape of the head and the markings around the eyes are much
the same in both sexes, and by these males and females of the
same species may be recognized.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><b>Misumena vatia</b> is the largest species and lives all over this
country and Europe. It is sometimes half an inch long, and
the first legs spread an inch and a half <a href="#f076-8.png">(fig. 77)</a>. It is white, with
sometimes a crimson spot on each side of the abdomen and
another on the front of the head between the upper eyes. The
sides of the thorax are a little darkened with yellow or brown,
which extends around the head to a
distinct opaque white spot under
and between the eyes <a href="#f076-8.png">(fig. 76)</a>.
This white spot widens below over
the mandibles and above under the
eyes and around the eyes of the
upper row. The shape of this mark
and the greater height of the head
distinguish this species from <i>aleatoria</i>
(figs. <a href="#f079-2.png">79, 80</a>). On the back of
the thorax is also a distinct opaque
white spot. The first and second
legs have usually a light brown
mark on the upper side, but this
is sometimes absent.</p>

<p>The male <a href="#f076-8.png">(fig. 78)</a> is only a quarter
or a third as long as the adult
female. The front legs are proportionally
longer than in the female,
and the abdomen smaller and
more pointed behind. The males
are strongly marked with reddish brown on a light ground.
The thorax is dark at the sides, while the front of the head
is white like that of the female.</p>

It is white or yellow, but does not have the crimson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
markings at the sides of the abdomen or between the eyes.
The head <a href="#f079-2.png">(fig. 79)</a> is rounder than in <i>vatia</i> and much lower in
front, and there is a narrow white stripe under the eyes that
divides at the sides, one branch passing around over the mandibles
and the other close under the eyes. The sides of the
cephalothorax are gray or green. The abdomen
usually has no markings except a little
gray color in the middle, but sometimes it
has two rows of dark brown spots <a href="#f079-2.png">(fig. 81)</a>,
and in such individuals the legs are also
marked with brown at the ends of the joints.
The males are very small and strikingly colored
<a href="#f079-2.png">(fig. 82)</a>. The two front pairs of legs
are brown, the cephalothorax green, and the
abdomen yellow. The shape of the head
and the white under the eyes are the same
as in the female.</p>

<p><b>Misumena asperata.</b>&mdash;The males and females
of this spider are more alike than in
<i>vatia</i> and <i>aleatoria</i>. The adult females are
always pale and sometimes white, but seldom
lose entirely the reddish bands around the
legs. Both sexes are covered with short
stiff hairs about their length apart all over
the upper part of the body and legs. The
usual color is pale yellow, with dull red
markings. The thorax is reddish at the sides. The abdomen
has two red bands or rows of spots on the hinder half, meeting
behind. In front are a middle pair of spots and two side bands
that spread apart in the middle and meet again at the spinnerets.
The tibia and tarsus of the front legs are marked with
a narrow red ring at the base and a wider ring near the end of
each joint. The female is a quarter of an inch long and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
male about half that length. The markings of the male are
like those of the female, but the spots are larger and more
deeply colored. The male palpi are larger than in the other
species.</p>

<p>The male <i>M. spinosa</i> of Georgia resembles <i>asperata</i>, but the
legs are much longer and the ends of the palpi smaller.</p>

<p><b>Synema parvula.</b>&mdash;A common species in the South. Length
about one-eighth of an inch. The thorax is as wide as long,
round and high in the middle. The abdomen is as
wide as long, widest across the middle, and a little
pointed behind. The third and
fourth legs are not more than
two-thirds as long as the first
and second, and lighter colored.
The thorax is orange-colored, a
little darker at the sides, and
with a dark brown line on the
edges over the legs. There are
light rings around the eyes.
The abdomen is white or light
yellow in front, and has a wide
black or brown band across the
hinder half, not reaching back
to the spinnerets, and sometimes partly divided by a notch in
front. On the front half of the abdomen are some small dark
spots and usually several opaque white marks. On the under
side of the abdomen there is a dark band on each side extending
back to and partly surrounding the spinnerets. The front
legs are orange brown, with the femora darker on the front and
rear edges. The other joints are a little darker at the ends.
The males are a little smaller and darker in color, but differ
little from the females.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE GENUS XYSTICUS</h3>

<p>In these spiders the general appearance is crab-like. The
abdomen is not much larger than the thorax, and both are flat
and wide. The first and second legs are a third longer than
the third and fourth. The colors are usually
various shades of brown and gray, in small
spots and bands. On the upper side of each
leg is usually a light line, with dark
lines on each side of it. The gait is
often sidewise, the legs kept close
to the ground, so that the spider can
move in a narrow crack. They live
under stones and bark and leaves,
and some, like <i>triguttatus</i>, on low
plants. The males have longer legs
and smaller abdomen and all the dark
markings larger and darker than the
females. In <i>triguttatus</i> there is great
difference between the sexes, but in
most species very little, as in <i>limbatus</i>
and <i>stomachosus</i>. The head is
generally low, and the four middle
eyes form a rectangle a little wider
than high <a href="#f095-7.png">(fig. 97)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Xysticus stomachosus.</b>&mdash;A middle-sized
and light-colored species, with
gray markings on a light ground,
the markings most distinct on the hinder legs and abdomen.
The middle of the thorax is lighter than the sides, and there
is a small dark spot in the middle and a larger one on each
side toward the hinder end (figs. <a href="#f087-8.png">87, 88</a>). The third and fourth
legs have a distinct dark spot at the ends of femur, patella, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
tibia. The abdomen is light, with a few small spots at the
front end and three pairs of dark transverse bands on the hinder
half. The hairs are short and fine. The male has longer legs
and is marked in the same way, with
the spots on the abdomen larger and
extended farther forward.</p>

the largest species, the females reaching
a length of a third to half an inch
(figs. <a href="#f089-0.png">89, 90</a>). The thorax is one-eighth
of an inch wide and nearly as
long. The abdomen is a little wider
at the hinder end. The legs are short,
the longest about half an inch in
length. The whole body is hairy.
The color is brown, the markings
dark on a light ground, best shown
by the figures. The middle of the
head and thorax is more fully
covered by the dark markings than
in other species. There is great
variation in the color, and young
spiders are usually lighter than
adults. Adult males and females in June
and July.</p>

brown or gray, with indistinct darker markings
(figs. <a href="#f091-2.png">91, 92</a>). The whole body is
covered with fine brown spots and has at the hinder end of the

legs are marked with
irregular dark and light spots, without
any distinct rings or markings, and the
first and second pairs are darker than
the others. In the male the first and

<p><b>Xysticus triguttatus.</b>&mdash;This is a small and very common
spider living on grass and low bushes. The female is about a
fifth of an inch long and the male as large but with a smaller
abdomen. The difference in the color of the sexes
is so great that they may easily be
mistaken for different species. The
females <a href="#f095-7.png">(fig. 95)</a> are straw-colored,
the abdomen almost white, and the
thorax and legs brownish yellow.
There are three black spots at the
back of the thorax and indistinct
darker bands at the sides. On the
abdomen are two black spots near
the front end and three pairs of
broken transverse stripes behind.
The male
<a href="#f095-7.png">(fig. 96)</a> has
the femora of
the two front
legs dark
brown, the
rest like the
female or a little darker. The thorax is
dark brown, except in the middle, where
it is a little lighter, as in the female. The
abdomen of the male is strongly marked
with transverse black and white stripes,
irregular toward the front end.</p>

light yellow, with light brown markings and black spots. The
cephalothorax has four narrow brown stripes, one on each side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
close to the edge and the others running back from the lateral
eyes <a href="#f098.png">(fig. 98)</a>; there are also two fine brown lines sometimes
extending from the middle eyes to the dorsal groove, but usually
broken in the middle. There is a brown spot just behind the
dorsal groove and two others in the middle of the cephalothorax.
On the abdomen there are two black spots at the front
end, two in the middle and two near the hind end, besides
several smaller ones along the sides. There
are four light brown lines across the hinder
half, each with a white line behind it, and
at the sides are oblique brown lines alternating
with white. The legs have a distinct
light line along the dorsal side and are

<p><b>Xysticus (Coriarachne) versicolor.</b>&mdash;The
thorax, abdomen, and legs are all much
flattened, the head is low, and the upper
and lower eyes nearer together than in the
other species. The colors are black and
gray in irregular spots on a light ground
(figs. <a href="#f099-0.png">99, 100</a>). On bark or unpainted
wood these spiders can hardly be seen.
Light individuals have black spots on the
legs at the end of each joint and the usual
three pairs of dark marks on the abdomen.
On the thorax is a white spot in the middle under the
front of the abdomen. Around this spot and behind the eyes
is black extending in spots along the sides. In dark females
and in most males the dark spots are so large that the whole
spider is nearly black.</p>

<p>This is a common spider, and a similar species, <i>Coriarachne
depressa</i>, is equally common in Europe.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE GENUS PHILODROMUS</h3>

<p>In these spiders there is less difference in length between
the front and hind legs than in Misumena or Xysticus. The
legs are long and slender, the
second pair longest, and the
body is small and flat, and
the abdomen pointed behind.
The colors are brown and gray,
and the whole body is often
covered with fine flattened hairs
that in the males are iridescent.
<i>Philodromus vulgaris</i> lives usually
on houses and fences, but
the other species on plants.</p>

and those of the male an inch and
a quarter (figs. <a href="#f101-4.png">101, 102)</a>. They
often stand with all the legs extended
sidewise, flat against a wall or fence
which they closely resemble in color.
When freshly molted they are covered
with fine gray hairs of the color
of weathered boards, that obscure
most of the markings. Older spiders
or those wet with alcohol are covered
with small gray spots forming a
stripe in the middle of the front of
the abdomen and a herringbone
pattern on the hinder half. The edges of the back of the
abdomen are dark and form a sharp line against the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
color of the under surface. The thorax is darker in the
middle and at the sides in irregular spots of gray. The legs
are spotted and darker toward the ends of the joints.
The under side of body and legs is light colored.</p>

The female is very distinctly marked with
dark brown on a white ground <a href="#f105.png">(fig. 105)</a>.
The middle of the thorax is white and the
sides brown nearly to the edge. The abdomen
is white, with a distinct brown band
on each side from the front more than half
its length backward. Sometimes there is
also an indistinct brownish pattern in the
middle, but this is usually
absent in adults, and the middle
is entirely white. Under
the abdomen the lateral brown
bands extend backward and
meet around the spinnerets.
The abdomen is wider than
in most species,&mdash;nearly as
wide as it is long across
the hinder half. The male
is very differently colored.
The legs and thorax are
orange brown, darker at
the sides of the thorax
and toward the ends of
the legs. The abdomen
is darker brown and
strongly iridescent with
red and green in a bright light. In alcohol it shows indistinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>

for Philodromus (p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>) or for <i>Ocyale undata</i> (p. <a href="#Page_88">88</a>).</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE ATTID&AElig;</h2>


<p>The Attid&aelig; are jumping spiders, many of them brightly
colored and quick in their movements and living in open places
among the tops of low plants. They are usually short and
stout spiders, with a large cephalothorax, which is wide in front,
where the eyes have a peculiar arrangement in three rows
<a href="#f118.png">(fig. 118)</a>, somewhat as in the Lycosid&aelig;, but with the middle
eyes of the front row much the largest, so that at first sight
many of them appear to have only two eyes.
The eyes of the second row are very small and
hard to see, and those of the third row are far
back on the head and usually turned a little
backward. The front legs are usually thicker
than the others, especially in the males. The
relative length of the legs is variable, the first
pair being commonly the longest, but sometimes
the fourth and even in some species the
third pair. The feet have two claws, with
many fine teeth and a thick brush of hairs.
The Attid&aelig; are usually thickly covered with hair or scales,
often brightly colored or iridescent, and their appearance is
often entirely changed by rubbing or wetting.</p>

</div>

<p>They walk backward or sidewise as well as forward, and many
of them jump great distances. They make no cobwebs, but
some species make silk tubes or bags on plants or under stones
in which they hide to molt or lay their eggs or to pass the
winter. There are often great differences in color and markings
between the sexes, and the males have peculiar bunches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of hairs and color spots on the legs and head. At the mating
time some of the males have peculiar ways of approaching the
female, holding their legs extended sidewise or over their heads
in such ways as to display their ornaments.
These mating habits have been
well described by G. W. Peckham, who has
made a special study of this family, in the
<i>Occasional Papers of the Wisconsin Natural
History Society</i>, of Milwaukee, in 1889.
This family is largely represented in more
southern countries, and our species belong
to a great number of genera most of whose
members live farther south.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Attus palustris.</b>&mdash;Large females are
quarter of an inch long, the males a little
smaller. The cephalothorax is a quarter longer than wide,
shorter in proportion to its width than in the next species,
<i>Saitis pulex</i>, which it much
resembles. The two sexes
resemble each other in markings,
but the females are lighter
and browner and the males
darker and grayer. The cephalothorax
has a narrow white
middle line, widened opposite
the dorsal eyes, and a shorter
white line just below the eyes
on the sides <a href="#f119.png">(fig. 119)</a>. The
edge of the cephalothorax is
also white. On the abdomen
the front middle spot is not so
distinct as in <i>pulex</i>, but in place of it are two white spots.
Behind these is a large transverse light marking, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
broken into two spots. The legs are dark or light gray, without
any distinct markings. The male palpi are smaller than in
<i>pulex</i>, though the males are larger. <i>Palustris</i> lives on plants
and makes nests among the leaves.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Saitis pulex.</b>&mdash;This is one of the smallest of the family. It
is about a sixth of an inch long, sometimes even smaller. The
colors are various
shades of gray like
the ground, and
when still it is
hard to find, but
it is an active
spider and exposes
itself by jumping
in open places.
The cephalothorax
is half longer
than wide, longer
and narrower than
in Habrocestum
and Attus. The
abdomen is usually
shorter than
the cephalothorax
and wider (figs. <a href="#f120-1.png">120, 121</a>). The
cephalothorax has a large light-colored triangle in the middle,
covering the head between the eyes in front and ending in a point
behind. In alcohol this spot disappears, especially in the males,
and the head appears black between the eyes and light behind
and at the sides. The front half of the abdomen has a light
middle stripe, lightest at the edges and darker gray in the
middle. Behind this is a transverse white spot nearly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
whole width of the abdomen and behind it several smaller light
markings. In the male these markings are brighter and the
surrounding dark color blacker than in the females. The legs
are marked with indefinite spots of dark gray on a lighter
ground, the contrast stronger in the males. The hairs all over
the body are short and fine and the spines on the legs distinct,
especially in the males.</p>

<p><b>Habrocestum auratum.</b>&mdash;In life this spider is covered with bluish
white hairs that give it a light gray color and obscure the markings.
The markings of the male are so much stronger that
those of both sexes can be best understood by describing the
male first <a href="#f122-3.png">(fig. 122)</a>. The cephalothorax has a white middle
stripe for a short distance back from the front eyes and two
distinct white stripes from the lateral front eyes back the whole
length. In the middle of the
head are two small white spots
and just behind them between
the posterior eyes two curved
white lines. The latter marks
show indistinctly in the females.
Down at the sides of
the cephalothorax are white
stripes meeting in front under
the eyes. The abdomen has a
white line extending entirely
around it and a middle stripe
of varying width.</p>

</div>

<p>The female <a href="#f122-3.png">(fig. 123)</a> has
only faint indications of the
markings of the cephalothorax, usually a little lighter color in
the middle and at the sides below the eyes. The white stripe
around the abdomen is broken into three pairs of oblique white
markings and the middle stripe into several spots or pairs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
spots. There is nothing distinctive in the markings of the
under side or of the legs except the ornaments of the male.</p>

<p>The front legs of the male
<a href="#f124-5.png">(fig. 125)</a> in this species are
much ornamented. The femur
has long black hairs on the
under side. The patella has
long black hairs beneath, a
spot of short black hairs on the inner
side, and a crest of long white hairs mixed
with shorter black on the upper side.
The tibia is covered with long black
hairs except at the tip, where they are
white. There is nothing peculiar about
the third leg <a href="#f124-5.png">(fig. 124)</a>. The form and
general appearance can best be understood
from the figures.</p>

<p>At the mating time the males, as they
approach the females, hold the front legs
extended sidewise and lifted a little from
the ground, with the tibia nearly horizontal
and the tarsus turned downward. In this
position they advance slowly, at the same
time running rapidly sidewise from one
side to the other and at short intervals
jerking the abdomen and the front legs
slightly upward. They go almost close
enough to touch the female and then
quickly retreat.</p>

<p><b>Habrocestum peregrinum.</b>&mdash;This is about

The abdomen has light markings in the middle similar to those
of <i>auratum</i>, but those at the sides are less distinct.</p>

<p>The male has the white stripes in the middle and around the
abdomen like <i>auratum</i>. The cephalothorax has the same white
lines at the sides under the eyes and at the posterior end. It
does not have a middle white stripe on the head between the
eyes or two white spots just behind it, as <i>auratum</i> has, but the
marking behind the eyes is more distinct, as it
is in the female. The front legs of the male
<a href="#f126-8.png">(fig. 127)</a> are not ornamented with long hairs
like <i>auratum</i>, but the third legs have a very
peculiar shape, the patella being wide and flat,
with a dark spot in the middle of the front side
<a href="#f126-8.png">(fig. 126)</a>. The shape of this joint is best
shown by the figure. When approaching the
female he holds up the front legs and draws in
the third pair so that the ornamented patell&aelig;
show from in front.</p>

<p><b>Habrocestum splendens.</b>&mdash;A little larger than
the other species, with the female distinctly
marked with black and white and the male with
brilliant red and iridescent scales. The females
are about a quarter of an inch long, sometimes
longer, and the males are a little smaller. The cephalothorax of
the female is covered with brown scales mixed with black hairs.
Across the middle, just behind the dorsal eyes, is a light band
that curves behind the eyes and extends forward in the middle.
The abdomen has a white band in front, one on each side, and
one in the middle, the rest being deep black. The shape of
these markings varies and the black parts are often broken
into two rows of spots. The cephalothorax of the male is
covered with dark iridescent scales, with blue, green, and purple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
reflections. The abdomen is covered with bright red shiny
scales mixed with fine black hairs. It is lighter in front and
at the sides, and in the middle shows indistinctly
through the scales dark markings like
those of the female <a href="#f129.png">(fig. 129)</a>. The legs are
dark like the cephalothorax.</p>

<p>Mr. Peckham says that when the male
approaches the female he lifts his abdomen
into an almost vertical position so that the
red color shows from in front. Then he
rises on the tips of his feet and, with the
front legs off the ground and pointing forward,
he dances back and
forth sidewise in front of
her, gradually drawing
nearer. At intervals
he stops and
turns his back to
her, then faces her
and dances again.</p>

being a little behind the middle, from which
it curves downward to the front eyes and
slopes abruptly backward <a href="#f130-1.png">(fig. 130)</a>. The
eyes are large and prominent, the front row
nearly straight and as wide as the widest part
of the cephalothorax. The posterior eyes
are nearly as large as the front middle pair and are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
middle of the cephalothorax. The abdomen is a little longer
and wider than the cephalothorax <a href="#f130-1.png">(fig. 131)</a>. The cephalothorax
is smoky gray, darker toward the front and darker in males
than females. The abdomen is gray, with yellowish markings
in a herringbone pattern through the middle. Common under
stones and leaves at all seasons.</p>

<p><b>Zygoballus bettini.</b>&mdash;This
is a very beautifully colored
spider, having in life spots of
white hairs and shining scales
of the color of copper and
bronze. The cephalothorax
of both sexes is high and wide
in the middle and slopes down
steeply from the posterior
eyes under the front of the
abdomen <a href="#f132.png">(fig. 132)</a>. The top
of the cephalothorax between
the eyes is nearly square.
The posterior eyes are almost
the full width of the cephalothorax
apart, and the front
row of eyes is nearly as long.
The cephalothorax is dark
brown covered with iridescent
scales. The legs are pale,
except the dark femora of the first pair and dark spots on the
ends of the joints of the fourth pair. In the male all the legs
are a little darker than in the female and without the spots on
the fourth leg. The abdomen of the female is light brown,
marked with white in a row of irregular spots. In the male
the abdomen is brown, covered with shining scales and with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
white band around the front and two white spots on each side.
The mandibles of the male are much elongated and bent apart
at the ends to make room for the long claw. At the inner
angle is a large tooth, and there is another one of complicated
shape on the middle of the under side.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 134.</span> Phidippus

</div>

<p>The usual length is about a third of
an inch in both sexes. The cephalothorax
is nearly as broad as long, and
the abdomen of the female as wide as
the thorax and a little longer.</p>

<p>The general color of the adult female
is yellowish brown, with black and white
markings <a href="#f133.png">(fig. 133)</a>. Around the front
of the abdomen is a white band, and on
the back are two indistinct longitudinal
black stripes in which are four pairs of
white spots. The general brown color
is produced by a mixture of scales and hairs of various colors.
The females are most brightly colored just before reaching
maturity, and then there is a large proportion of yellow and
orange scales in their covering and the black stripes and white
spots are more distinct. The hairs and scales are of various
shapes, the most common being that of slightly flattened hairs.
The yellow and orange scales are wider and less pointed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the white spots have short and wide scales. Under the abdomen
the color is light gray, with two parallel darker stripes.
The legs are pale in the middle of the joints and dark toward
the ends and covered with gray and black hairs. The palpi are
light yellow.</p>

<p>In alcohol the orange color disappears almost entirely, the
black and white markings become less distinct, and all the
colors browner. The colors of the male <a href="#f134.png">(fig. 134)</a> are entirely
different. The cephalothorax and legs to the end of the tibia
are black. The palpi are black, with a stripe of white scales on
the upper side. Around the front end of the abdomen is a
white stripe; the sides are bright orange red and the middle
black. Between the orange and black are three pairs of white
spots. They make a bag of white silk
among leaves, in which in the early summer
a male and female may sometimes
be found together and in which the female
later makes a cocoon of eggs. The young
hatch soon and become half grown before
winter.</p>

is round and nearly as wide as long. The
front row of eyes is little longer than half
the greatest width of the cephalothorax.
The cephalothorax is flat on top for almost its whole length
and in front about twice the diameter of the largest eyes in
height. The mandibles are large and bright metallic green in
front <a href="#f118.png">(fig. 118)</a>. The legs are stout and short, the fourth pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
extending little beyond the spinnerets. The first and fourth
pairs are of the same length, but the first are twice as thick as
the fourth. The legs are without markings and darker toward
the head. The abdomen is longer than the cephalothorax and
as wide or wider. There is little difference
between the sexes, the males being only a little
darker colored and larger in front. Usually
found under stones in a thick silk nest.</p>

bright white spots on the back of the abdomen
<a href="#f136.png">(fig. 136)</a>. Large females are half an
inch long and the males a little smaller.
Though the general color is black, it is modified,
especially in fresh specimens, by white
hairs on parts of the body. The joints of the
legs are grayish in the middle and black
toward the ends. There are white hairs on
the front of the head and upper side of the
palpi and a white band around the front of
the abdomen, plainest in the males. The
three large white spots on the abdomen correspond to the
second and third pairs in <i>mystaceus</i> <a href="#f135.png">(fig. 135)</a> and <i>multiformis</i>
<a href="#f133.png">(fig. 133)</a>, and the other pairs, though generally present, are
small and inconspicuous. On the under side of the abdomen
are usually two gray stripes. This is a common spider all over
the country. It lives under stones and sticks and passes the
winter half grown in a thick silk bag.</p>

the hinder eyes. The front middle eyes nearly touch each
other. The lateral eyes are half their diameter higher than
the front ones. The middle eyes are nearer the
lateral than the dorsal. In the males the front
eyes are nearly their diameter above the mandibles,
and below them is a white band and a line of white
hairs from the middle of the head
down to the base of the first legs.
The legs are rather
slender in both sexes
and long in the males.
The fourth pair are
longest in females, and
in males the first and
fourth are the same
length. The markings
of the abdomen are much alike in both
sexes, with two light stripes, more definite in
the males, bordered by a few small black
spots irregularly arranged. The stem of
the abdomen is long, and the abdomen and
thorax appear farther apart than in
many species. In the females the
cephalothorax is pale, with a few gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
spots from the middle toward the sides. In the males the legs
are dark brown except the inner half of the femur of the third
and fourth, which is light like the abdomen. The male cephalothorax
is dark and has a square white spot between the eyes,
two white lines pointing up from the third and fourth legs each
side, and two short white lines under the dorsal eyes. The
under side of the thorax and legs is dark or light like the upper
side. The underside
of the abdomen is
usually darker in the
middle and sometimes
has a few black
spots each side. This
is a common spider
in the southern states
and has been found as
far south as Brazil.</p>

<p><b>Dendryphantes militaris.</b>&mdash;This
spider
resembles in many
ways the next species,
<i>Dendryphantes
&aelig;stivalis</i>, but is one-half
larger and has
a shorter and wider
cephalothorax. The general color is brown, covered with gray
and black hairs. The abdomen of the female is brown, with
white at the front end and four pairs of oblique white marks in
the middle and four at the sides <a href="#f140-1.png">(fig. 140)</a>. In the male the
cephalothorax has a white band on each side under the eyes
and a white band around the abdomen, with a dark middle area
<a href="#f140-1.png">(fig. 141)</a>. The dark parts of the legs and cephalothorax are
darker than the same parts in the female. The palpi are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
slender in both sexes, and in the male the palpal organs are
small for so large a spider. The mandibles of the male
are widened at the end and have a strong projection with two
teeth on the inner corners.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Dendryphantes &aelig;stivalis.</b>&mdash;One
of the most common
Attid&aelig;, on all kinds of bushes
and small trees, and one of
the most variable in size and
color. Large females are
from a fifth to a quarter of
an inch long, and the males
are smaller. The females are
of two varieties, which run
into each other. The light variety <a href="#f142-4.png">(fig.144)</a>
has the light parts white or light
yellow and the dark parts dark brown
covered with white hairs and scales.
The cephalothorax is dark brown, thinly
covered with scales, so that the dark
color shows between them in places.
The legs are light yellow and translucent,
indistinctly ringed with brown at
the base and, near the tip of each joint,
all covered with greenish white hairs.
The palpi are light and without rings
except on the femur and patella. The
abdomen is brighter yellow than the
thorax, with four pairs of purplish brown
spots, the second pair largest, connected with a paler brown middle
marking. The abdomen has beneath a purple brown
stripe in the middle and oblique brown marks at the sides.
Sternum, maxill&aelig;, and mandibles light brown. The dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
variety <a href="#f142-4.png">(fig. 143)</a> is generally smaller and covered with longer
hairs and scales. The legs and palpi are more distinctly ringed
with brown. The dark spots on the abdomen are larger and
more closely connected, so that
the markings appear as light
spots on a dark ground.</p>

<p>In alcohol they become bright
red and afterward fade to a dull
red color that remains for a long
time, both varieties in this condition
looking much alike.</p>

<p>The males <a href="#f142-4.png">(fig. 142)</a> differ, at
first sight, extremely from the
females. The legs are ringed as
in the female and the brown parts
are wider and less obscured by white hairs,
while the white parts are whiter. The
cephalothorax is dark brown, with a white
stripe on each side under the eyes bending
toward each other but not connected.
The front of the head is also white and
covered with long white hairs. The palpi
have the femur dark brown at the base
and white at the end. The patella and
tibia are brown, and the tarsus is brown,
with white hairs on the upper side. The
abdomen is white in front and
around the sides. The middle
is dark brown, with a few yellow
and greenish scales. The brown
area is often notched at the sides in four points and sometimes
indistinctly divided into four pairs of spots, as in the female.
The male palpi are large for the size of the spider, and the
palpal organ extends back beyond the tibia.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><b>Icius palmarum.</b>&mdash;This is very common on trees and bushes,
and may be mistaken for <i>Dendryphantes &aelig;stivalis</i>, which it much
resembles. It differs from <i>&aelig;stivalis</i> in both sexes in being a
little smaller and more slender and in the females lighter
colored. In the males the head is wider, the front legs longer
and darker colored than in <i>&aelig;stivalis</i>, and the mandibles longer
and more nearly horizontal.</p>

<p>The living female has the legs and palpi transparent white,
sometimes a little darker at the ends of the joints. The whole
body is covered with light gray or white scales mixed with fine
black hairs. The abdomen has a row of darker triangular spots
in the middle and oblique rows of small spots at the sides. In
alcohol the legs become yellow and the rest of the body red,
as in <i>&aelig;stivalis</i>, afterward fading to a dirty yellow. The markings
of the abdomen become more distinct and in some individuals
form four large dark brown spots.</p>

<p>The males have the front legs very dark brown.
The other legs are transparent white. The cephalothorax
and abdomen are dark reddish brown
mixed with shining greenish white scales and
sometimes copper red around the eyes. On
each side is a white stripe the whole length
of the body, the two meeting in front below
the eyes. The mandibles, maxill&aelig;, and palpi
are dark brown. Some males show indistinctly
dorsal markings of the abdomen like the
female. The mandibles of the male are
longer than those of the female and more
or less turned forward according to their
length. In some the mandibles are only a
little longer than those of the female, and in these the patella
and tibia of the front legs are not much longer than the femur.
In others, usually larger spiders, the mandibles are nearly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
long as the cephalothorax and extend forward horizontally, the
maxill&aelig; are longer, and the first pair of legs have the patella and
tibia one and a half times as long as the femur. The female is
longer in proportion to its
width than in <i>&aelig;stivalis</i> and
has the front legs stouter.
The epigynum has two small
anterior openings directed forward
instead of toward each
other, as in <i>&aelig;stivalis</i>. This
and the next species live on
low bushes all summer.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Icius mitratus.</b>&mdash;This species
closely resembles <i>Icius palmarum</i>,
differing mainly in color.
The legs are all white in both
sexes, and the mandibles of the
male are white and not long and horizontal, as in <i>palmarum</i>.
The females resemble <i>palmarum</i> so closely that it is difficult
to tell them apart. The cephalothorax is a trifle wider, and
the abdomen narrower, and the front legs longer than in
<i>palmarum</i>. The general color is whiter, and the spots on the
abdomen are more distinct, as in <a href="#f145-8.png">fig. 148</a>. The male has the
legs white or a little greenish, with long white hairs, those on
the front legs longer than the diameter of the legs. The rest
of the body is white, except a light brown stripe in the middle
of the cephalothorax and abdomen, covered with light yellow
hairs, through which three or four dark spots show indistinctly
on the abdomen <a href="#f149.png">(fig. 149)</a>. When fighting with other males,
or when approaching the female, the hairy front legs are
straightened and extended sidewise.</p>

as wide as long, with the sides nearly straight and parallel in
the female but widened behind the middle in the male. The
abdomen of the female is oval and nearly twice as long as wide.
The color is bronze green, changing in some lights to copper
red. The legs are yellow, with longitudinal dark stripes, except
the front femora, which are dark brown.
The males are much more brightly colored.
The legs are orange, darker toward the ends,
with fine dark longitudinal stripes. The ends
of the front tibi&aelig; are dark brown and have
long brown hairs on the inner and upper
side. The palpi are orange, darker toward
the end. The sides and hinder part
of the cephalothorax are orange,
and there is a white line over the
cox&aelig;. The upper part of the cephalothorax
and abdomen is covered
with greenish yellow scales. On
the front of the head are two tufts
of long hairs, yellow mixed with
black, pointing forward and a little
inward between the middle and
lateral eyes. On the hinder end
of the abdomen is an iridescent
purple spot. The abdomen is
green on the under side, and the
sternum and cox&aelig; are orange. In
alcohol all the colors become dull.
The mandibles are slender, and the claw short and strongly
curved inward toward the point. In the male the mandibles
are a little longer and hollowed a little on the inner side. The
male has the first pair of legs much longer and larger than the
others. In the female the fourth legs are longest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

fourth pair longest in the females and the first and fourth
of equal length in the males. The female <a href="#f152.png">(fig. 152)</a> has the
legs and palpi translucent yellow or greenish white. They are
marked with indistinct light gray rings and black spots at the
base of the hairs and spines. The cephalothorax is dark brown
between the eyes
and translucent
like the legs in
the thoracic part.
There is a fine
black line in the
middle and one on
each side and a
few gray marks
radiating from the
dorsal groove.
The whole top
of the cephalothorax
is covered with greenish
yellow scales mixed
with gray hairs. The
eyes are black, and
sometimes there is a
red stripe under the
eyes at the sides. The
abdomen is covered
with scales which in the middle and at the sides are gray and
mixed with black hairs. There are two longitudinal bands of
light red and indistinct angular marks of the same color in the
middle of the hinder half. On the under side the colors are light
gray and yellow, with spots of darker gray on the abdomen.</p>

<p>The males are of two very different colors. One kind <a href="#f153-4.png">(fig. 154)</a>
resembles the female. The red bands on the abdomen are
broken up into rows of spots connected with the middle
angular markings. The gray
and black spots on the legs and
cephalothorax are larger, and
there are several black marks
on the front of the abdomen.
The palpi are bright orange
yellow, with the tibial hook
black and a black spot on the
inner side of each joint. The
size of the black spots varies
in different individuals, and so
this passes into the other variety
<a href="#f153-4.png">(fig. 153)</a>, in which the cephalothorax
and abdomen are entirely
black and the palpi black, except
a few orange hairs on the outer
side. The black cephalothorax and abdomen are covered with
dark greenish shining scales. The legs in this variety are
transparent white except the hairs, and on the front of the head
are three tufts of long hairs which are wanting in the light-colored
males.</p>

<p><b>Epiblemum scenicum.</b>&mdash;This is the common gray and white
spider that lives on houses and fences <a href="#f155-6.png">(fig. 155)</a>. It is about
quarter of an inch long, the cephalothorax half longer than wide,
and the abdomen a little wider and longer. The front of the head
around and above the eyes is white. There is a white stripe
on each side of the cephalothorax, and in the middle two white
spots, one each side of the dorsal groove. On the abdomen
there is a white stripe across the anterior end, and two oblique
marks on each side. The legs are gray, with white rings not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
very distinctly marked, and the palpi white. On some individuals
the white marks are more definite than on others, the
gray ground having but few white scales mixed with it. In
others yellow and white scales are
largely mixed with the gray, and so
the contrast with the white spots is
less. The males <a href="#f155-6.png">(fig. 156)</a> differ but
little in size, color, or markings from
the females, but the male mandibles
are much larger and extend horizontally
in front of the head, sometimes
two-thirds as long as the cephalothorax.
This is a common European,
as well as American, spider. It is
occasionally found on the ground or
on plants, but commonly on and
about houses.</p>

<p><b>Marptusa familiaris.</b>&mdash;This is another
common species on fences and the outside
of houses <a href="#f157.png">(fig. 157)</a>. When full
grown it is half an inch long. The
whole body is much flattened, and
both the cephalothorax and abdomen
are widened in the middle. The
cephalothorax is rounded at the sides
and three-quarters as wide as long,
and the abdomen is half as wide as
it is long. The legs are long and
stout, the fourth pair one-half longer
than the abdomen.</p>

<p>The general color is gray, with long
gray and white hairs. The cephalothorax has a dark brown
band along the edge on each side, which is larger and darker in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the males. The abdomen has in the middle a yellowish white

hinder half notched at the sides. The legs are darker at the
ends of the joints and light in the middle. The under
side of the abdomen has a dark middle stripe.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Hyctia pikei.</b>&mdash;A slender species a quarter to a third
of an inch in length, with the abdomen twice as long
as the cephalothorax, and in general appearance like
a seed or piece of straw <a href="#f158.png">(fig. 158)</a>. The whole body
is covered with silvery white hairs mixed with a few
longer black ones. The markings of the back in
the male are a dark middle stripe on the abdomen,
partly divided by notches into four spots
and a fine middle line and two less distinct side
lines on the cephalothorax. In the female the
stripe on the abdomen is less definite and is
broken up into spots, and in young spiders the
whole body is pale yellow or greenish. The
front legs are as long as the abdomen in both
sexes, colored brown, and with the middle joints
thickened. They are not much used in walking,
being extended straight forward and raised
enough to clear the ground while the spider
walks with the other six. The other legs are
pale and slender.</p>

<p>The elongated shape of this spider distinguishes
it from all the other common Attid&aelig;.
The markings and the position of the legs, two
pairs pointing forward and two backward,
increase the long appearance. The basal joints of the fourth
legs are brought close together, and those of the first pair
almost as close. The labium and maxill&aelig; are a little longer
than usual and are partly covered by the first legs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>I have found this spider common on sand grass, where nothing
else grows, and the young lying lengthwise on the leaves could
hardly be seen. They mature in the middle of the summer.
When the male approaches the female he raises
the front legs at an angle of sixty degrees with
each other, raises the abdomen a little, and
advances by short runs, twitching
the front legs and abdomen every
few moments.</p>

The cephalothorax is one-half
longer than wide, very low and
flat, with the sides parallel for half
its length. The front middle eyes
are large and close together, the
lateral
eyes half
as large
and a little separated from them. The
first legs are twice as thick as the others
and have the femora flattened, but in
the female the fourth legs are longest.
The abdomen is as wide as the cephalothorax
and a little longer. The hairs
all over the body are short. The
cephalothorax is black, smooth, and
without markings. The abdomen is
dark gray, with two rows of white spots often indistinct and
perhaps sometimes absent. The legs have the femora and patella
and tibia of first and second pairs black or dark brown and the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>

other joints light and black at the ends. The under side is

<p><b>Hasarius hoyi.</b>&mdash;This species may be known by its peculiar
colors,&mdash;the dark portions brown or black and the light parts
white and orange brown (figs. <a href="#f161-2.png">161, 162</a>). These colors are, as
usual, brighter and the markings more distinct in the males.
In front around the eyes the cephalothorax is covered with
white hairs. At the sides a white band extends backward
under the eyes, turning inward but not reaching the middle
line. There is a light band, part white and part orange,
around the abdomen and several angular marks in the
middle, two of them in the hinder half, sometimes
united into a large spot. In alcohol, and less
plainly seen when alive, is a light band under
the hairs, extending across the middle
of the cephalothorax and forward
on the sides under the eyes.</p>

<p>In females all these markings are
less distinct, but traces of them can
be found in most individuals. The
colors are more brownish, and the
markings of the abdomen smaller
and more uniform in shape. The
markings of the legs are dark on
the middle joints and light at the
base and on the tarsi, with strong
contrasts in color in the males and
little in the females. The length of
this species is about a quarter of an

<p><b>Synemosyna formica.</b>&mdash;A small spider so much like an ant as
to be often mistaken for one <a href="#f163-4.png">(fig. 163)</a>. It is about quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of an inch long and very slender. The cephalothorax is
narrowed behind and the abdomen in front, and each has a
deep depression in the middle. The stem of the abdomen is
flat, and widened behind so that it is nearly as wide as the ends
of the thorax and abdomen, which it connects. The
front middle eyes are large and cover two-thirds of
the width of the front of the head, and the rest of the
eyes are small. The legs are all slender, the hind
pair longest. The general color is black, with yellowish
or orange-white markings. There is a triangular
white spot in front of the dorsal groove, and one on
each side widening downward under the posterior
eyes. On the abdomen there is a white stripe
extending downward from the dorsal depression on
each side and uniting in a large white patch underneath
<a href="#f163-4.png">(fig. 164)</a>. In pale individuals the whole front
half of the abdomen is light yellow or orange brown.
The second legs are entirely white, the others partly
black. The male has the head higher and is darker colored
and more slender.</p>

<p>This spider not only resembles an ant in form and color but
moves like an ant. It does not jump like most Attid&aelig;, though
it can do so, but walks and runs irregularly about and lifts its
first legs high like the antenn&aelig; of ants.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Lyssomanes viridis.</b>&mdash;A bright green spider common in the
southern states. The arrangement of the eyes differs from
that usual in the Attid&aelig; by the front lateral eyes being higher
and closer together, so that they are over and behind the front
middle pair <a href="#f165.png">(fig. 165)</a>. The cephalothorax is narrow in front,&mdash;not
much more than half as wide as it is across the middle.
The abdomen is narrower than the thorax and more than twice
as long as wide. The female is a third of an inch in length,
and the male quarter of an inch. The legs are long and slender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the first pair longest and thickest, in the male half an inch in
length and in the female a little shorter. In the female the
mandibles are vertical and about as long as the height of the
head. In the male they are as long as the cephalothorax, curved
apart, and extended almost horizontally in front of the head.
The color is light transparent green, sometimes without any
markings. Usually there are four pairs of small black spots on
the abdomen, and there are black spots around the eyes, except
around the front pair, where there is a little orange color. They
live on low bushes and mature early in the summer.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE LYCOSID&AElig;</h2>


<p>The Lycosid&aelig; are among the commonest spiders, or, at any
rate, those most often seen. Most of them live near the
ground and move actively about without attempting to conceal
themselves. Their colors are black and white or the colors of
the ground, stones, and dead leaves, sometimes nearly uniform
all over the body, in other kinds arranged in a distinct pattern,
with strong contrasts between the light and dark parts. In
some species the markings are brighter and more characteristic
on the under side than on the back. The legs are long, the
fourth pair longest. The spines on the legs are long and often
darker colored than the skin, and when the spider is active they
stand out from the legs and make them appear larger. The
first and second legs are more covered with fine short hairs and
have the spines shorter and less easily seen than the third
and fourth. The feet have three claws, the under one small
and covered by the surrounding hairs. The eyes have a peculiar
arrangement, the front row being small and nearly straight,
the middle pair of the upper row just above them and much
larger, while the lateral eyes of this row are carried back and
upward on the sides of the head so that the eyes are really
in three rows of four, two, and two <a href="#f168-0.png">(fig. 170)</a>. In those species
with low heads, like Dolomedes, the upper row of eyes is less
curved and smaller, and the whole arrangement resembles
that in Tibellus and others of the Thomisid&aelig;. The body is
usually long and the head high, the abdomen about as long and
as wide as the cephalothorax and as thick as it is wide.</p>

<p>Our largest spiders belong to this family. The females
carry their eggs in round cocoons attached to their spinnerets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and the young for a short time after coming out are carried
about on the back of the mother. Dolomedes and Ocyale
carry their cocoons in the mandibles and spin a loose web in
bushes, where the young live for a time after leaving the cocoon.
The young of most species pass the winter half grown and
mature the next summer. Most of the little spiders seen
spinning their threads on the tops of plants and fences in the
Indian summer are young Lycosid&aelig;.</p>

<p>Most of these spiders belong to two genera, Lycosa and
Pardosa, the first including the larger species, with the eyes
covering only a small part of the front of the head and the
front row about the same length as the second; the other,
Pardosa, consisting of comparatively small species, with the
four upper eyes very large and covering the whole top of the
head and the front row much shorter than the second.</p>


<h3>THE GENUS LYCOSA</h3>

<p>The genus Lycosa includes spiders that differ greatly in the
proportions of different parts of their bodies. In general, they
are large and stout and their legs short compared to those of
Pardosa and Dolomedes, the front legs being not much longer
than the body. In the short and stout species, like <i>pratensis</i>
<a href="#f168-0.png">(fig. 170)</a>, the eyes cover only a small part of the head, while in
the longer legged and more slender species, like <i>communis</i>
<a href="#f181-2.png">(fig. 181)</a>, they are larger and spread farther apart. The head
is highest behind and rounded downward in front, but less so
in those species with large eyes. The spines of the legs are
comparatively small and on the two front pairs concealed by
the surrounding hairs. The fine flattened hairs on the front
feet sometimes form a thick brush on the under side, extending
up from the claws as far as the tibia. The colors are all
shades of brown and gray.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Lycosa nidicola.</b>&mdash;When full grown three-quarters of an inch
long; the legs short, the longest an inch in length. The
color is dull yellow or greenish brown. On
the cephalothorax there is a narrow yellow
stripe in the middle and one on each side
<a href="#f166-7.png">(fig. 166)</a>, and on the front of the abdomen
the usual pointed stripe, dark at the edges
and bordered by lighter bands. On the
hinder half of the abdomen are indistinct
cross marks. The legs are without markings,
and the spines short and hardly visible.
The under side of the abdomen
<a href="#f166-7.png">(fig. 167)</a> is light in the middle
and darker at the sides
and marked with small
brown spots.
The males and
young are lighter

This spider lives
under stones and other shelters in the woods
in a shallow nest, lined with silk, where the
female may be found with her cocoon of
eggs early in the summer.</p>

the edge are faintly lighter than the rest. The abdomen has
a pointed middle stripe, dark at the edges, extending back half
its length, and behind this four or five dark cross stripes. The
legs are darker toward the ends; the femora are marked with
two broken dark bands, and the patella and tibia of the third
and fourth legs have faint dark rings. The spines are small
and, on the two front pairs of legs, hardly visible among the
other hairs. The under side is light colored, with
the ends of the legs darker. The epigynum is
short and wide. The males differ little from the
females. This does not seem to be a

The eyes are very close together,
especially the two of the middle row,
which is much shorter than the front

gray, light in the middle, with dark transverse marks behind
and closely placed dark spots at the sides, much as in <i>Tegenaria

on the surface of the ground. The males <a href="#f174-5.png">(fig. 174)</a> are half or
five-eighths of an inch long and spread two inches. They are
colored like the sand,&mdash;a little redder sometimes in the middle
spots and on the femora, and gray at the sides. There is a
spot in the middle of the abdomen edged with black and
a black band on each side of the head divided in front, the
branches extending to the lateral eyes of both rows. The
ends of the palpi and the spinnerets are black. The mandibles
are black, except in the middle, where they are covered with
bright yellow hairs. On the under side <a href="#f174-5.png">(fig. 175)</a> the two front
pairs of legs, sternum, and mouth parts are black, the hinder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
legs and abdomen light sand color, like the back. The female
<a href="#f173.png">(fig. 173)</a> is larger,&mdash;three-quarters of an inch or more in length.
The color is more gray or slate color, darker in front and
lighter behind, as in the male. The cephalothorax has a
light gray band in the middle, and the abdomen
a middle dark band broken at the sides by three
or four pairs of light spots. The front two pairs

<p>In August the males wander about on
the sand and are easily caught. Though
their color is much like the sand, the
marks of the back and legs make them
more easily seen than <i>L. cinerea</i> <a href="#f177-8.png">(fig. 177)</a>
and other sand spiders. The females live
in holes three-quarters of an inch wide
and ten inches or more deep. The sand
is held together by silk, which is very
thin below but thicker toward the opening.
Sometimes bits of sticks and straw
are fastened around the hole, but as often
it is entirely clean and not concealed in
any way. The females keep near their
holes and drop into them at the least
fright. As one walks across the neighborhood
no spiders are to be seen, only
open holes. After a short time they
come to the surface, at first slowly, but sometimes, as they see
the place clear, with a sudden jump, and stand over the hole
ready to drop back into it. The color of the females is more
gray or slate color than that of the males. The markings of
the abdomen are larger and more distinct, but the black on the
thorax and front legs is less marked than in the males.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

female is sometimes over an inch in length, with the
fourth legs an inch and a half long, so that it spreads over
three inches. The males have the legs as
long but more slender, and the body is
smaller, measuring three-quarters of an

<p>On the under side the whole
body is black, including the
first and second joints
of the legs and the
maxill&aelig;. The legs

ends of the joints. The mandibles
are brown, with orange-yellow
hairs on the front.
There is sometimes a little
yellow on the ends of the first
and second legs and palpi of
the male.</p>

<p>The female makes a hole,
but not a deep one, and hides
in it with her eggs, but is often found running
about on the ground.</p>

gray marks, so that, when it lies flat on the sand, it
can hardly be distinguished from it. The body is half
an inch long, and the fourth legs nearly
an inch. The under side is white or gray,
and the whole body covered with white
and gray hairs. The legs are marked with
indistinct dark rings, two or three to each
joint. On the cephalothorax the spots
radiate irregularly from the dorsal groove;
the space between the eyes is dark, and
the mandibles are dark brown. The markings
of the abdomen are broken
up into small spots, so that there
is little of the usual figures. The
male palpi are

grown, and the fourth legs three-quarters
of an inch. The upper eyes
are larger than in <i>pratensis</i> and <i>nidicola</i>, and cover
half the width of the head, as in <i>communis</i>. The
cephalothorax is light gray in the middle and dark
at the sides and around the front of the head.

front pointed stripe is large. The
light stripes at the side of it are
wide and distinct, uniting on the
hinder half of the abdomen into
a middle stripe, broken sometimes
into a row of four or five
spots. In dark individuals this
light marking is yellow and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
strongly defined than in lighter ones. On the thorax, especially
in light colored-spiders, there are usually two or three light
marks radiating from the dorsal groove. The legs, except the
ends of the first and second, are marked with rings at the ends
and middle of the joints, indistinct in light spiders and brighter
in dark ones.</p>

<p>The length is two-fifths to half an inch. The legs are long,
the fourth pair three-quarters of an inch in length. The second
row of eyes is a little wider than the first, and the second eyes
are large and their diameter apart <a href="#f181-2.png">(fig. 182)</a>.
On the under side of the abdomen are two
dark stripes meeting at the spinnerets so as to
form a horseshoe-shaped figure, but in some very
dark individuals the whole under side of the
abdomen behind the epigynum is dark colored.
There is little difference between the sexes.
The females carry eggs in June and July.</p>

on account of the dark
head and front legs and especially
the thick covering of
black hairs on the tibi&aelig; of the
first pair. The cephalothorax
has a distinct light middle
stripe, narrower and straighter
in the male (figs. <a href="#f184-5.png">184, 185</a>).
The middle of the abdomen is
yellow, with the pointed stripe
only a little darker and marked
with black spots around the edges. At
the sides the abdomen is brown, broken
in spots, and in the middle of the hinder
half are three or four cross marks. The
legs are yellowish and ringed with gray
in the females. In the males the femora
and the sides of the thorax are much
darker brown, and the tibi&aelig; of the front
pair dark and thickly covered with hairs.
The male palpi have the patella and tibia
thickened and about as wide as long.
The front legs are plainly thicker than the second in both
sexes. The second row of eyes is wider than the first. The
length of either sex is a little over quarter of an inch. The legs
are slender and thinly covered with long fine hairs. The longest
leg is about half an inch.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE GENUS PARDOSA</h3>

<p>Pardosa consists of comparatively
small spiders, all of them long legged and
slender. The head is high in front, and
the four upper eyes large
and spread over the whole front
of the head <a href="#f197-1.png">(fig. 200)</a>. The
front row of eyes is plainly
shorter than the second
row. The colors are generally
dark, often
black, and with
white markings.
The spines of the
legs are long, even
on the front pairs,
and the whole body
is often covered
with long hairs. To
show the comparative
size of the different
species of this genus, all
the figures are made on the
same scale, four times the
real size.</p>

<p><b>Pardosa lapidicina.</b>&mdash;Four-fifths
of an inch long and with long
legs, the fourth pair three-quarters of an inch long.
The color is black, the whole body being covered
with black hairs that obscure the few light markings
<a href="#f186-8.png">(fig. 186)</a>. When looked at closely, especially after
being wet, the legs appear a little lighter colored toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the ends, and the femora faintly marked with light rings. In
the middle of the cephalothorax there is a large light spot,
widest just in front of the dorsal groove, and at the sides are
rows of irregular light spots. On the abdomen are three or
four pairs of light spots near together in
the front half, and behind are two rows of
spots meeting over the spinnerets. On the
under side the color is a lighter gray than
on the back. The color, as in all spiders,
varies according to age, the young and freshly
molted having a deeper black color, while
older ones are gray. The epigynum is shown
in the figure <a href="#f186-8.png">(fig. 188)</a>, and is quite constant
in shape. It distinguishes this species from
<i>greenlandica</i> <a href="#f189-0.png">(fig. 189)</a>, for which it is most
likely to be mistaken. The male differs little
from the female. This spider lives among
gray stones in the hottest and driest places
from Connecticut to Labrador.</p>

<p><b>Pardosa albomaculata</b> or <b>greenlandica.</b>&mdash;This
species resembles <i>lapidicina</i> <a href="#f186-8.png">(fig. 186)</a>, but is
a little larger and not quite as long legged.
It has longer hairs and is marked with bright
white spots on a black ground. There are
two rows of white spots on the abdomen, and
others along the sides of the cephalothorax
and on the legs <a href="#f189-0.png">(fig. 189)</a>. Wet in alcohol
it shows similar irregular markings on the
abdomen as <i>lapidicina</i>, but the light spots
on the thorax are smaller, the middle one extending forward
only to the dorsal groove. The epigynum <a href="#f189-0.png">(fig. 190)</a> is large
and distinct. Its outline has been compared to that of a
decanter, narrow in front and rounded out at the sides behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
There is a long narrow middle lobe, generally widened at the
end, but varying much in shape. At the front end of the epigynum
are two small depressions. It resembles the epigynum
of <i>glacialis</i> <a href="#f191-2.png">(fig. 192)</a>, but is always longer and
narrower and has the middle lobe straighter and
more distinct. White Mountains, on bare
stones. Rocky Mountains, Canada, and
Greenland.</p>

<p><b>Pardosa glacialis</b> or <b>brunnea.</b>&mdash;One-third
of an inch long. Color dark brown with
some light markings. In the middle
of the cephalothorax is a light
stripe, widening and fading out
toward the eyes and divided by a
dark middle line, widest in front
and extending back as far as the
dorsal groove <a href="#f191-2.png">(fig. 191)</a>. On each
side is a light stripe extending
under the eyes to the front of the
head. The abdomen has the middle
pointed stripe light colored, and sometimes
there are four or five pairs of small
spots of white hairs on the hinder half. In
alcohol there are obscure cross markings and
black spots. The legs are marked with longitudinal
dark and light lines. On the under side
there is usually a light middle stripe on the front of the sternum,
and the middle of the abdomen is lighter than the rest. The
whole body is hairy; there are long black hairs on the front of
the head, and the spines are long and colored like the legs. The
epigynum <a href="#f191-2.png">(fig. 192)</a> has a narrow middle lobe transparent at
the end so that it is difficult to see, and dark brown pieces
at the sides, with the outer ends turned forward. The shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
can best be understood from the figure. The epigynum varies,
but distinguishes this species plainly from <i>greenlandica</i> <a href="#f189-0.png">(fig. 190)</a>,
with which it is likely to
be associated. The male
palpi are large and black
at the ends, the tarsus
oval and pointed, and the
tibia short and as thick as
long.
This spider
has been
found all
over Canada and
as far north as Greenland. It
is common in the White Mountains and has been
found as far south as Connecticut.</p>

<p><b>Pardosa tachypoda</b> or <b>montana.</b>&mdash;This is a
Canadian and White Mountain spider found
as far south as Massachusetts <a href="#f193-6.png">(fig. 193)</a>. It
is smaller than either <i>greenlandica</i> or <i>glacialis</i>
and larger than <i>nigropalpis</i> and <i>albopatella</i>.
The colors are more like the last two
species, but the legs are darker and more
distinctly ringed. The light markings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the cephalothorax and abdomen are less distinct and more
broken and irregular. The epigynum <a href="#f193-6.png">(fig. 195)</a> has a characteristic
shape different from any of the allied species, the two
anterior depressions being wide apart and the middle ridge
narrow and rounded at the end. The male palpi <a href="#f193-6.png">(fig. 196)</a> are
rather slender, as in <i>lapidicina</i>, and uniformly colored, and all
the differences between the sexes are less strongly marked
than in <i>nigropalpis</i> and <i>albopatella</i>.</p>

<p><b>Pardosa pallida.</b>&mdash;One-fifth
of an inch long and brightly
marked with black
and brown on a light
yellow ground (figs. <a href="#f197-1.png">197, 199</a>). The
cephalothorax is narrower
than in most
species. The cephalothorax
has two
wide gray stripes
and a fine black line
on the edge at each side.
The abdomen has the middle
pointed stripe light brown
with a broken black edge.
On each side is a black band,
made up of spots closer toward
the middle and more scattered
toward the sides. The legs are light yellow, with a few black
spots near the body. The spines of the legs are long but
not dark colored. On the under side there are dark spots on
the sternum near the base of each leg, and sometimes two rows
of spots or two bands nearer the middle. On the under side
of the abdomen are two black stripes, sometimes connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
behind. In the males <a href="#f197-1.png">(fig. 199)</a> the colors are darker and the
dark markings larger. The ends of the palpi are large and
covered with black hairs.</p>

<p>In one freshly molted young male there was hardly any
trace of the spots on the sternum. The male palpi were dark
gray with black hairs, except the tarsus, which was light
colored, with a dark spot
in the middle and a few
black hairs. The
markings of the
abdomen were very indistinct,
and the light color
brownish, while the thorax
and legs are slightly
green. The first
femora were black
toward the end.</p>

The male with head and palpi black <a href="#f202-4.png">(fig. 203)</a>. In the
female the cephalothorax has a large light middle stripe,
widest between the eyes and the dorsal groove, and a narrow
light stripe on each side <a href="#f202-4.png">(fig. 202)</a>. The abdomen is light in
the middle for its whole length in an irregular stripe partly
divided by faint cross lines of gray. The sides are darker and
spotted with black. The legs are faintly marked with darker
rings. In the male the contrast between the light and dark
markings is greater, the markings of the cephalothorax are
smaller and brighter, and the head and palpi are black and
covered with black hairs.</p>

<p><b>Pardosa albopatella.</b>&mdash;Smaller than <i>P. nigropalpis</i>, but resembling

of the cephalothorax is narrower. The middle stripe of the
abdomen is narrower and brighter at the front end. The
femora are distinctly marked with four rings, and the other
joints less plainly. In the male the ends of the legs are pale,
without rings, and the rings of the femora are broken into spots
except on the front legs, where the femora are black. The
palpi <a href="#f205-7.png">(fig. 206)</a> have the femora black and the patella white.
The tibia is dark, and the tarsus is dark at the base and white
toward the tip.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Pirata piraticus.</b>&mdash;A small and active spider living in short
grass in summer and under leaves in winter. The colors and
shape of the body are much like <i>Lycosa pratensis</i> <a href="#f168-0.png">(fig. 168)</a>, but
the legs are proportionally larger and longer, and the colors
brighter. The length is about a quarter of an inch. The
front and second rows of eyes are of the same length, those
of the second row large and their diameter apart <a href="#f208-9.png">(fig. 209)</a>.
The eyes of the upper row are nearly as large as those of the
second, and twice as far apart. The color is pale
yellow, with gray or black markings. The
cephalothorax has a narrow light line in
the middle and one on each side <a href="#f208-9.png">(fig. 208)</a>.
In the middle of the front of the abdomen
is a light stripe with dark edges, which
tapers into a line or row of spots behind
the middle. At the sides of this are light
stripes that unite behind, and outside of
these are dark markings becoming smaller behind.
The legs have conspicuous dark spines, especially
the hinder pair, and are faintly marked with rings
or sometimes are without markings.</p>

<p>Dolomedes and Ocyale differ in many respects from the
other Lycosid&aelig;. They are more flattened, have the head lower,
and the eyes all more nearly of the same size. The front row<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of eyes are small and near together. The upper row is about
twice as long and strongly curved, and the eyes are nearly
equal in size and twice as large as those of the front row (figs.
<a href="#f213-6.png">214, 216</a>). In Dolomedes the lower eyes are about half as
high as the top of the head. In Ocyale they are lower and
farther apart, and the head resembles still
more Tibellus of the Thomisid&aelig;. Both Ocyale
and Dolomedes resemble this family in their flattened
body and wide thorax.</p>

<p><b>Dolomedes sexpunctatus.</b>&mdash;Dark
greenish gray or, in young
spiders, yellow, with a silvery
white line each side the whole
length of the body, meeting in
front under the eyes and reaching
back to the spinnerets <a href="#f210-2.png">(fig. 210)</a>. In the middle of the
cephalothorax is a narrow light
line. On the hinder half of the abdomen
are four pairs of small white spots, and
sometimes another pair near the front end.
On the under side the general color is
lighter, and there are six dark spots on
the sternum <a href="#f210-2.png">(fig. 211)</a>. The cephalothorax
is three-quarters as wide as long, but looks
narrower on account of the white stripes.
The abdomen is proportionally longer than
in <i>tenebrosus</i> <a href="#f213-6.png">(fig. 213)</a>. The full-grown
female is six-tenths of an inch long, with a spread of an inch
and three-quarters. In winter and spring the half-grown young
are very common everywhere. It lives near water and runs
easily on it, each foot making a depression on the surface without
becoming wet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a><br /><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Dolomedes tenebrosus.</b>&mdash;This is one of our largest spiders,
spreading its legs over four inches. The color is light and
dark gray. The legs are indistinctly marked with light and
dark rings and have long
dark spines <a href="#f213-6.png">(fig. 213)</a>.
The thorax is dark in the
middle and lighter toward
the eyes. On each side
are light bands that extend
around under the eyes and
meet in front. The abdomen
has three pairs of
transverse dark stripes,
each with a light border
on the hinder edge. The
cephalothorax is four-tenths
of an inch long and
three-tenths wide, half as
wide in front, and nearly
straight on the front edge.
It is rounded in the middle,
but not very high,
and just behind the eyes
is nearly flat. The under
side of the thorax and legs
is light colored, without
markings, the abdomen a little darker. The abdomen is as
long as the thorax, widest across the middle, and a little pointed
behind. The male has longer legs and is more slender and
strongly marked; under the fourth femora near the end is a
bunch of stiff hairs. The male palpi are long, with large tarsi
and palpal organs and a long hook on the outer side of the
tarsus. They live near water, on the ground or low bushes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
The female carries her cocoon in her mandibles and makes a
large bunch of silk in the bushes, in which the young live for
some time after hatching.</p>

</div>


<p><b>Ocyale undata.</b>&mdash;When full grown over half an inch long, the
thorax quarter of an inch, and the first and fourth legs an inch
long. The thorax is almost as wide as long, and the head not
much more than half as wide <a href="#f213-6.png">(fig. 215)</a>. The abdomen is long
and narrower than the thorax and a little pointed behind. The
color is a light brownish yellow, with a wide darker and browner
band on the middle of both thorax and abdomen. This band
is bordered by a white line a little curved
in and out toward the tail. In younger
spiders the color is lighter and yellower;
the middle stripe has the edges more
undulating, and in very young ones it is
serrated or even broken up into spots.
The legs, which are plain in adults, are
sometimes marked with rings in the
young. The front end of the stripe is
sometimes divided into two. These
spiders live on bushes, without any web,
until they have young. In the latter
part of summer the females carry their
flat cocoons under them, holding on with
the mandibles. When the young are
about to hatch the female builds a mass
of web <a href="#f217.jpg">(fig. 217)</a> three or four inches
through, in which she leaves the cocoon,
and the young come out and live for a
time together in the web.</p>

two. The head is wide and less separated from the thorax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
than in Lycosa and very high in front. The cephalothorax is
two-thirds as wide as long and rounded both in front and
behind <a href="#f218-9.png">(fig. 218)</a>. The abdomen of the male is smaller than
the cephalothorax, but that of the female is wider and longer.
It is widest in the middle, rounded in front, and pointed
behind. The legs are slender, the first pair longest, but all
nearly of the same length and with very long spines.
The colors and markings are very
variable. The legs are white or
pale yellow, with black spines. The
light parts of the body are the same
color, with brown and black markings.
There are usually four brown stripes on
the cephalothorax from the eyes backward,
and two black lines in front from the lower
eyes down the front of the mandibles
<a href="#f218-9.png">(fig. 219)</a>. The most constant mark of the
abdomen is a pointed middle spot extending
as far as the middle of the back. This is
generally surrounded by light color, and at
the sides are narrow oblique brown marks.
There are sometimes fine black lines on the
under sides of the femora and a wide black
middle stripe under the abdomen. The
males are sometimes colored like the female,
and vary from this to black abdomen and palpi, with the rest
of the body pale. A very common species in the southern
states in the early summer, running on low bushes. There is
another Oxyopes about the same size that has been found a
few times as far north as New England.</p>

<p><b>Oxyopes (Peucetia) viridans.</b>&mdash;This is a common and conspicuous
spider in the South. It is a bright transparent green, with red
spots and black spines. It grows to a length of three-quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of an inch, but is found in great numbers early in the summer,
when it is only a quarter of this size <a href="#f220.png">(fig. 220)</a>. The head is
narrower than in <i>O. salticus</i>, and the lateral eyes so high that
they appear to belong to the upper rather than the middle
row. The abdomen is the same width as the back part of the
cephalothorax and tapers a little toward the spinnerets. The
first pair of legs is longest and the second next. The general
color is green, with the space between the eyes red, red spots
and black spines on the legs, and two rows of red spots on the
abdomen, sometimes united into a stripe, with pairs of white
spots surrounded by red.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE AGALENID&AElig;</h2>

</div>

<p>The larger Agalenid&aelig; are the makers of the flat wide
cobwebs that are so common on the grass and in the corners
of barns and cellars. They resemble some of the Drassid&aelig;,
especially Agr&oelig;ca and Anyph&aelig;na (pp. <a href="#Page_1">1-14</a>). The head is
large and marked off by shallow grooves from the thorax, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
is often contracted behind the eyes, so that it is narrower there
than in the front. The mandibles are large and, in the females,
much swelled at the base in front. The arrangement of the
eyes differs little from that in the Drassid&aelig;. The upper spinnerets
are longer than the others and have the terminal joint
narrowed toward the end, with the spinning tubes on the inner
side. The feet have three claws, like the Lycosid&aelig;, and do
not have the brush of hairs common in the Drassid&aelig;. The
males and females differ little in size, but the males have longer
legs and smaller abdomen and large and complicated palpi.</p>

<p><b>Agalena n&aelig;via.</b>&mdash;This spider is known everywhere by its web,
which it makes on grass, among stones and weeds, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
houses  (figs.<a href="#f221.jpg">221</a>, <a href="#f222.jpg">222</a>). It varies greatly in size and color.
Large females may be three-quarters of an inch long, with legs
measuring an inch and a quarter, while others may be full grown
at half that size. In color some are pale yellow with gray
markings, and others reddish brown with the markings almost
black. Whatever the color, they
are thickly covered with fine gray
hairs. The cephalothorax has two
longitudinal gray stripes and a black
line along the edge on each
side <a href="#f223-5.png">(fig. 223)</a>. The head
is high and a little
darker in front.
Both rows of eyes
are strongly
curved, with the
middle eyes highest,
so that the middle
eyes of the
lower row and the
lateral of the upper
row form a nearly
straight line <a href="#f223-5.png">(fig.224)</a>. The mandibles
are stout,
not much swelled
in front, and
covered with hair. The abdomen is gray or
black at the sides and lighter brown in the
middle, with two rows of white or light-colored
spots. The upper spinnerets are more than twice as
long as the others, and the terminal joint much longer than
the basal. The legs are large and long, the fourth pair almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
twice as long as the body. The legs are marked with dark
rings at the ends of the joints and lighter rings in the middle
of femur and tibia. On the under side the cox&aelig; are light
colored and the sternum dark, and there is a broad dark
middle band on the abdomen from the hinder legs to the spinnerets.
The males are as large as the females, with longer
legs and smaller abdomen. The male palpi have a very large
black tube coiled one and a half turns under the tarsus
<a href="#f223-5.png">(fig. 225)</a>. The web <a href="#f222.jpg">(fig. 222)</a> is flat and shaped according to
the surrounding objects to which it is fastened, with a tube at
one side in which the spider hides. The eggs are laid in August
and September in a flat cocoon, attached by one side in some
sheltered place and covered with silk, often mixed with dirt.
Most of the adult spiders die before winter, and females are
often found dead on or near their cocoons. The young hatch
in the winter and leave the cocoon early in the spring, and
soon begin to build their webs among the short grass. The
webs become more distinct when covered with dew, but,
though too transparent to be seen at other times, they remain
in the same places throughout the summer and are repaired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and enlarged as the spider grows. If, however, the web
should be destroyed, the spider is able in one day to make
a new one as large as the old, but thin and transparent. The
web contains many long threads crossing it from one side to
the other and nearly parallel, and these are crossed in all
directions by finer threads <a href="#f226.jpg">(fig. 226)</a>. The long threads are spun
from the lower spinnerets, the upper pair being held up over
the back, out of the way. The fine threads are spun from the
upper spinnerets, which are swung from side to side as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
spider moves along. There is nothing adhesive about the web.
It serves merely as a clearing where insects may alight to rest
and the spider may have a good
chance to run after them. Where
the web is made under plants or
rocks a great number of threads are
carried upward from it, which may
help in stopping insects <a href="#f227.jpg">(fig. 227)</a>, as
they do in the webs of Linyphia.

</div>

<p><b>Tegenaria derhamii.</b>&mdash;This is a common
species in barns and cellars,
and has probably been imported from
Europe, where it is even more common.
The head is high and wide,
as in <i>T. medicinalis</i>. The mandibles
are less swelled in front and the
eyes are closer together than in that
species, and cover more than half
the width of the head <a href="#f228-9.png">(fig. 229)</a>. The
cephalothorax is shorter and wider
across the hinder half and the abdomen
shorter than in <i>medicinalis</i>, and
the legs are longer and more hairy.
The colors are lighter and the hairs
of the whole body longer. The
female is two-fifths of an inch long.
The cephalothorax is pale, with two
gray stripes. The abdomen is marked
with a series of gray spots, formed of
a middle row more or less connected with two side rows; the
front of the abdomen often pale, with the markings faint
<a href="#f228-9.png">(fig. 228)</a>. The legs are long, the first and fourth pairs nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
twice the length of the body. They are marked with faint gray
rings at the ends and two in the middle of each joint. The
palpi are long and slender in both sexes, and those of the
male have the patella and tibia of about the same length and
each nearly twice as long as wide. There are no processes on
the patella, but two small teeth on the tibia near its end. The
tarsus is small and narrow, not as long as the patella and tibia.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 232.</span> Web of Tegenaria derhamii curving downward on each side.</span>
</div>

<p>The webs are made in all parts of cellars and unswept buildings,
sometimes forming a shelf in the corner, not as large or
as flat as those of <i>A. n&aelig;via</i>, but with a similar tube on the most
sheltered side <a href="#f230.jpg">(fig. 230)</a>. The webs more often spread under
beams and floors fastened up by threads at the sides and edges,
and, as they gather dust, hang down by its weight and become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a><br /><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
torn and tangled. Old webs are repaired and extended until
they become as thick as cloth with silk and dirt. The tube is
generally smaller and less funnel shaped where it enters the
web than that of Agalena. The web is not as flat as that of
Agalena, curving usually down from the
tube and up in front of it, often turning
up abruptly at the edge. Sometimes it
is fastened up in the middle of the
front edge and curves downward each
side <a href="#f232.jpg">(fig. 232)</a>.</p>

<p>Fig. 231 shows a web of the most
common form in the corner of a cellar,
with the spider standing at the mouth
of the tube, and the remains of egg
cocoons hung up at the left. This
web was at least a year old, and the
front edge had just been extended with
clear and transparent silk, while the
middle was black with coal dust.</p>

<p>Fig. 232 is another web in the same
cellar, with the front edge fastened up
to the boards above. It is drawn
tightest in the middle and curves
down on each side.</p>

loose bark. It is half an inch long, with
the legs of the female not much longer
<a href="#f233-4.png">(fig. 233)</a>. The head is large and wide,
and the eyes cover a little more than half its width. It is a
little constricted in front of the legs and raised above the
thorax as far back as the dorsal groove. The abdomen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the females is large and oval, widest across the hinder half.
The spinnerets are small, but plainly two-jointed, and the upper
pair longest. The general color is light yellow
brown, covered with gray hairs, the cephalothorax
browner, and the abdomen grayer, than
the legs. The cephalothorax has two indistinct
gray stripes. The abdomen is marked with a
series of gray spots of irregular shape, smallest
toward the front and larger and darker toward
the end. The legs are faintly ringed with gray,
more distinctly in the young.</p>

<p>The epigynum varies in appearance according to the thickness
and color of different parts. The two figures show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
common varieties (figs. <a href="#f236-7.png">236, 237</a>). This species and <i>longitarsus</i>
are both easily mistaken for <i>Amaurobius sylvestris</i> and <i>ferox</i>,
which are of the same size and color and live in the same
situations. Amaurobius does not have the long upper spinnerets
like Tegenaria, the eyes are lower on the front of
the head, and there are larger light-colored markings on the
front of the abdomen. The young of <i>Tegenaria medicinalis</i>
are pale, with light gray markings, and the cephalothorax is
marked with spots radiating from the dorsal groove <a href="#f233-4.png">(fig. 234).</a>
The web of this spider is not flat like that of Agalena, but
curved in various shapes according to the place where it is
built. If there is an open level place near the nest, the web
spreads across it, but usually curves upward at the edges and
is fastened to surrounding stones and weeds. Where the
spider lives in the cracks of a wall or rock, the net spreads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
along the surface of the rock, held away from it a short distance
by threads fastened to projecting points on the stone
(figs. <a href="#f239.png">239</a>, <a href="#f240.jpg">240</a>). This species is sometimes mistaken for the
longer legged and more hairy <i>Tegenaria
derhamii</i> <a href="#f228-9.png">(fig. 228)</a>, that makes similar
webs in barns and cellars.</p>

<p><b>Tegenaria (C&aelig;lotes) longitarsus.</b>&mdash;Smaller
than <i>medicinalis</i>; about two-fifths of an
inch in length. The head is very wide,
and the mandibles of the female more
swelled in front than in <i>medicinalis</i>, and
the eyes are smaller and cover less than
half the width of the head (figs. <a href="#f241-9.png">244, 245</a>). The cephalothorax is darker
colored in front and does not have the
two longitudinal stripes seen in <i>medicinalis</i>
<a href="#f241-9.png">(fig. 241)</a>. The legs are only
faintly marked with gray in the middle
of the joints. The abdomen is marked
with gray, in a series of dark and light
spots, as in other species, and of more
regular shape than in <i>medicinalis</i>. The
epigynum is light colored, with a middle
bar covered with hair and slightly
forked at the hinder end <a href="#f241-9.png">(fig. 242)</a>. The
male differs in the usual way from the
female and has the palpi shorter than
<i>medicinalis</i>. The tarsus has a projection
at the base that covers the tibia.
The patella has a short process on the outer side that points
directly forward <a href="#f241-9.png">(fig. 243)</a>.</p>

dead leaves in woods <a href="#f241-9.png">(fig. 246)</a>. It is a fifth to a quarter of an
inch long, with the longest legs one and one-half times as long
as the body. The spines of the third and fourth legs are long
and stout, and there are long fine hairs on all the legs and
the abdomen. The color is pale yellowish brown, lighter on the
abdomen, which has faint gray markings. The sexes are much
alike, and both vary in size. The palpi of the males are very
large and conspicuous (figs. <a href="#f241-9.png">248, 249</a>). The patella is short and
wide, and the tibia is narrower at the end and wide toward the
base, where it has a short process on the outer side. On the
under side of the tibia is a long thin appendage of irregular shape
that is nearly as long as the tarsus. The tarsus itself is long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a><br /><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and narrow, and the palpal organ large and complicated, with
a long fine tube that extends from the base along the outer
side and back to the hard appendages in the middle. The
epigynum <a href="#f241-9.png">(fig. 247)</a> has a small, transverse, oval opening at
the hinder end, in front of which the coils of long tubes can be
seen through the skin.</p>

<p><b>Hahnia bimaculata.</b>&mdash;The Hahnias resemble Tegenaria, but are
much smaller and have the spinnerets extended in a line across
the under side of the abdomen <a href="#f250-1.png">(fig. 251)</a>. <i>Hahnia bimaculata</i>
is about one-eighth of an inch long, with the abdomen
large and oval, widest behind, as it is in
C&aelig;lotes <a href="#f250-1.png">(fig. 250)</a>. The
cephalothorax is bright
orange brown, and the
legs and abdomen pale yellowish
with gray markings. The
legs are ringed with gray, the
longer joints having two
rings, and the abdomen
has a pattern of
light yellow and gray
spots. The spinnerets
are all long and in a
nearly straight line, half as
long as the width of the
abdomen. The outer or
upper pair are half as long
as the abdomen, and the two joints are nearly of equal length.
The tracheal opening is in the middle of the abdomen, nearer
the epigynum than the spinnerets. The sternum is as wide as
long, widest opposite the second legs. The maxill&aelig; are straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
in front and have a slight projection at the outer corners, where
there are two or three stiff hairs. In some other species there
is a longer process at these corners.</p>

<p>This spider is common in winter under stones and under
leaves. In summer it makes webs close to the ground, among
short and thin grass and moss.</p>

<p><b>Hahnia cinerea.</b>&mdash;About a twelfth of an inch
long; much smaller than <i>bimaculata</i> <a href="#f250-1.png">(fig. 251)</a>.
The color is dark gray, the cephalothorax and
legs brownish, and the legs a little lighter at the
ends of the joints. The abdomen has a row of
angular light spots in the middle. The spinnerets
are in not quite as straight a line as in
<i>bimaculata</i>, the outer pair being a little higher
and farther behind the next. The tracheal opening
is not as far forward as in <i>bimaculata</i>, being nearer the
spinnerets than the epigynum. The male palpi have the
appendages of patella and tibia longer than in <i>bimaculata</i>,
and softer and more curved. They are found under stones
and leaves.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>The Theridid&aelig; are the builders of the loose and apparently
irregular webs in the upper corners of rooms, in fences and
among rocks, and between the leaves and branches of low trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and bushes. They are generally small, soft, and light-colored
spiders, with the abdomen large and round and the legs slender
and usually without spines. The eyes are all about the same
size and in two rows across the front of the head, with the
lateral eyes of the two rows near together and often touching
each other. The mandibles are weak and without teeth at
the end. The maxill&aelig; are pointed at the end and turned
inward toward each other. Most of the Theridid&aelig; live always
in their webs, hanging by their feet, back downward. The webs
have in some part a more closely woven place under which the
spider stands, sometimes in the middle of the web, sometimes in
a corner out of sight. Where the spider's usual standing place
is without other shelter, it is often concealed by pieces of leaves
or sand carried into the web by the spider, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
made into a tent. The outer part of the web is usually
loosely made in large meshes, but is sometimes in a distinct
sheet spreading from the nest and held out by threads in all
directions. The cocoons are round and soft and hang in the
web, several being made in the same season by one spider.</p>

<p>Several of this family, like Spintharus and Euryopis, have
the abdomen smaller and flatter than usual and the fourth legs
longer, so that they are better fitted for walking. They are
found on plants, and little is known about their webs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The Theridiums are small soft-bodied spiders, making large
and loose webs without any large flat sheet of silk, but only a
slightly closer portion where the spider stands, or a nest or tent
connected with the web. <i>Theridium tepidariorum</i> <a href="#f258-0.png">(fig. 258)</a>
and <i>rupicola</i> <a href="#f261.png">(fig. 261)</a> live in houses or among rocks, making
large loose webs, in which the spider often stands without
any covering. They have the abdomen high in front and
tapering a little toward the spinnerets. <i>Theridium globosum</i>
<a href="#f262.png">(fig. 262)</a> has the abdomen of the same shape. The other
species are all small and have the abdomen round and brightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
colored. They live in more open places on plants, where they
make nests in which they are partly hidden, and carry their
webs over the neighboring leaves and twigs (figs. <a href="#f253.jpg">253</a>,
 <a href="#f254.jpg">254</a>).</p>

</div>



<p><b>Theridium tepidariorum.</b>&mdash;This is one of the most common
house spiders, and is often found in its webs among rocks, but
seldom on plants. The females <a href="#f258-0.png">(fig. 258)</a> measure sometimes
over a quarter of an inch in length, but may mature much
smaller. The legs of the first pair are nearly three times the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
length of the body. The male <a href="#f258-0.png">(fig. 259)</a> is shorter and has
longer legs. The color varies from dirty white to almost black.
The cephalothorax is yellow brown, and the legs light yellow,
with brown or gray rings at the ends and the middle of the
joints. In the males the legs are orange brown, darker at the
ends of the joints. The abdomen is high in front and narrows
toward the spinnerets. In dark
and well-marked specimens the
abdomen has, on the hinder part,
six transverse black marks curved
upward, thicker in the middle, and
partly connected by black spots
at the ends <a href="#f258-0.png">(fig. 260)</a>. These
marks are most sharply defined
on the hinder edge, where they are
bordered by silver white. The upper
mark often forms a conspicuous black
and white spot in the center of the
abdomen. In light individuals all the
markings are smaller and less definite.</p>

<p>It makes a large web in the corners
of rooms, under furniture, and in the
angles of fences and between stones
<a href="#f255.jpg">(fig. 255)</a>. It usually stands in the
most sheltered part of the web, where
a part of it is more closely woven than
the rest, but not enough so to conceal the spider. It occasionally
makes the web in an open place where there is no shelter
above, and then it sometimes carries a piece of leaf into the
web and hides under it, as is the usual habit with some allied
species. The webs of the young are usually more regular in
form than those of adults (figs. <a href="#f256.jpg">256</a>,
<a href="#f257.jpg">257</a>). A male and female
often occupy the same web for a long time. The eggs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
laid in brownish pear-shaped cocoons, several of which are made
in the same season by one spider and hang in the web. This
species is found all over the world.</p>

<p><b>Theridium rupicola.</b>&mdash;This resembles closely <i>tepidariorum</i> and
is easily mistaken for the young of that species. It does not
grow larger than an eighth of an inch
long. The colors are like <i>tepidariorum</i>,
usually dark gray with black spots, the
back of the abdomen sometimes almost
white. The legs are distinctly ringed
with light and dark. In the middle of
the abdomen is a pointed hump, the
front part generally black and the hinder
part white <a href="#f261.png">(fig. 261)</a>.</p>

<p>It lives under stones and among
rocks, in webs like those of <i>tepidariorum</i>, often containing
grains of sand which look as if placed there by the spider,
as sand falling into such a web would go through without
sticking to the threads.</p>

<p><b>Theridium globosum.</b>&mdash;This is another species with a high
abdomen like <i>tepidariorum</i>. It is about a twelfth of an inch
long and almost as high <a href="#f262.png">(fig. 262)</a>. The
abdomen is a little flattened behind and
pointed toward the spinnerets. The
hinder part is white, with a large black
spot in the middle, below which is sometimes
a smaller black spot. Sometimes
there is a bright white line around the
light area. The front upper part of
the abdomen is yellowish gray, and the
under part brown. The cephalothorax is orange brown,
except a black spot between the eyes. The legs are
orange brown.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

middle stripe often very brightly colored, with white or yellow
at the edges and red in the middle <a href="#f264-6.png">(fig. 264)</a>. The rest of the
abdomen is reddish brown, darkest next to the white edge of
the stripe. There are no distinct marks on the under side.
In males the stripe on the abdomen is obscure, and the whole
abdomen dark reddish brown <a href="#f264-6.png">(fig. 265)</a>. Sometimes, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
in young spiders, the abdomen is entirely yellow, with indistinct
brown markings. The cephalothorax is orange brown, often
darker in the middle, but with no distinct stripe. The legs and
palpi are yellow in females and orange brown in males, slightly
darker at the ends of the joints. The epigynum has no openings
in sight. They are on the inner
side in the transverse fold across the
abdomen. The palpal organ <a href="#f264-6.png">(fig. 266)</a>
has two appendages at the end, one hard
and roughened and the other soft. The
web is on low plants of all kinds, usually
two or three feet from the ground <a href="#f263.jpg">(fig. 263)</a>. There is sometimes
a small tent, often hardly deep enough to cover the
spider, from which the web spreads two
or three inches, according to the shape of
the plant. The cocoons of eggs are
white and nearly as large as the spider,
and are attached in the nest.</p>

<p><b>Theridium murarium.</b>&mdash;Length about
one-eighth of an inch, with the abdomen
nearly spherical. The general color is
gray. The legs are pale, with dark bands
at the end and middle of each joint. The
cephalothorax is pale, with a dark line in
the middle and one on each side, the
middle line sometimes divided into two
near the eyes <a href="#f267-9.png">(fig. 267)</a>. On the abdomen
there is an undulated middle stripe, white at the edges and the
front end, and reddish in the middle. On both sides of this
stripe the abdomen is nearly black and becomes gradually lighter
toward the sides. The sternum is pale, with a black edge and
black stripe in the middle. The under side of the abdomen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
is gray, with a long black spot in the middle and a smaller one
over the epigynum. There is little difference in size or color
between the sexes. The epigynum <a href="#f267-9.png">(fig. 269)</a> has two round
holes, wide apart, near the thickened edge. The palpal organ
<a href="#f267-9.png">(fig. 268)</a> is shorter and simpler than it is in <i>differens</i>.</p>

<p><b>Theridium spirale.</b>&mdash;This is a round-bodied spider of the same
size as <i>differens</i> and <i>murarium</i>. The cephalothorax is orange
brown above and below, with an indistinct dark stripe as wide
in front as the eyes and narrowed behind. The abdomen has a
middle stripe like <i>differens</i>,
nearly as wide
in front as it is in the
middle <a href="#f270-3.png">(fig. 271)</a>. The
rest of the abdomen
is gray, darkest toward
the stripe. The legs are
pale, sometimes with faint gray
rings at the ends and middle of
each joint. The middle stripe of
the abdomen is sometimes reddish
as in <i>murarium</i>, but oftener
gray, with a dark spot near the
front end. The males <a href="#f270-3.png">(fig. 270)</a>
have the same color and markings as the female and are
sometimes more distinctly marked. The male palpi <a href="#f270-3.png">(fig. 272)</a>
are very large, and the palpal organ has a long tube coiled on
the under and outer side. The openings of the epigynum
<a href="#f270-3.png">(fig. 273)</a> are about their diameter apart.</p>

<p><b>Theridium frondeum.</b>&mdash;White, light yellow, or greenish white,
with black markings that are very variable <a href="#f274.png">(fig. 274)</a>. Usually
the cephalothorax has two fine black lines running back from
the eyes and uniting behind the dorsal groove, and black edges.
The legs are usually darkened with brown at the ends of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
joints. The abdomen is large and round, and has on the back
a light undulated band bordered by brownish translucent
spaces, with two black spots
just over the spinnerets.
Sometimes there are black
spots in the translucent
spaces, especially toward the
hinder end, and these may
be united into two long
black stripes. In some individuals
of either sex the
black on the cephalothorax
forms a wide band in the
middle, almost covering the back,
and a black stripe of similar width
extends backwards on the abdomen
for half its length. These black-striped
individuals have all the other variations of color and
markings. The males have all the colors and spots brighter
and the legs longer than the females. The
mandibles of the male are longer than those of
the female and have at the base, in front, a low
conical point.</p>

<p>This species is found from the White Mountains
to Alabama. In New England it matures
in July and is found on bushes all summer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>



<p><b>Theridium unimaculatum.</b>&mdash;This little species differs in color
and markings from all the others, and may almost always be
distinguished by the white abdomen, with a black spot in the
center of the back. The females are a twelfth of an inch long
and the males smaller. The cephalothorax is orange yellow,
with a black spot around the eyes, extending back in a point
as far as the dorsal groove, and there is also a fine black line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
along the edges. The legs are orange, lighter in the female
and darker in the male, with the first and second pairs in the
male much stouter. The sternum is orange, with black edges.
This spider makes a web, like the other small species, among
small leaves and winters under dead leaves on the ground.</p>

<p>Steatoda has the legs shorter and stouter than Theridium.
The abdomen is oval and often a little flattened on the back.
It is smooth and shining, the hairs being fine and scattered so
as to be hardly visible. The thorax is thick and hard, and in
some species marked with hard
projections and depressions. The
head is generally narrow, and the
front middle eyes are in several
species larger than the others and
farther forward and wider apart.
In other species all the eyes are
about the same size. The webs
consist of a flat sheet supported
and held down by threads.</p>

<p><b>Steatoda borealis.</b>&mdash;This is a dark
reddish-brown spider, quarter of
an inch long, living among stones
or in the corners of fences and
window frames, generally well
concealed by its web or nest. The cephalothorax is orange
brown and covered with short stiff brown hairs. The head is
one-third as wide as the thorax and a little higher, the eyes near
together, with the front middle pair projecting forward beyond
the mandibles <a href="#f277-9.png">(fig. 279)</a>. The legs are brown, with faint darker
rings, and are thickly covered with hairs. The abdomen is dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
chocolate brown, sometimes without any light marks on the
upper side, but usually there is a light line running around
the front half and another in the middle, extending back half the
length of the abdomen and usually broken into several spots.
The four depressed spots on the abdomen are distinctly marked.
On the under side there is a light stripe on each side, meeting
behind the spinnerets. The sexes are much alike in size and
color, but the palpi of the male <a href="#f277-9.png">(fig. 278)</a> are longer than the
cephalothorax, and the terminal joint is very large and complicated.
The web consists of a flat sheet, held out by threads in
all directions, but is often so crowded into a corner that its
structure is hard to understand <a href="#f276.jpg">(fig. 276)</a>.</p>

</div>


<p><b>Steatoda guttata.</b>&mdash;Only one-tenth of an inch long. The
cephalothorax is high, with scattered hairs, at the base of each
of which is a horny ridge. The cephalothorax is
dark brown, with the legs lighter and more yellow.
The abdomen is nearly spherical and hard
at the front end, where there is a ring around
its attachment to the thorax. Sometimes the
abdomen is bright yellow or orange, without
markings on the back, but oftener it is partly
brown, with two or three pairs of silvery white
spots <a href="#f280-1.png">(fig. 280)</a>. The males and females are alike
in size and color, and the palpi of the males are
very large, as in <i>borealis</i>. They live under stones
at all seasons and mature in April and May.</p>

<p><b>Steatoda marmorata.</b>&mdash;About a quarter of an inch long. The
cephalothorax and legs yellowish brown. Cephalothorax smooth,
with a few hairs. Legs covered with fine hair. The abdomen
is usually nearly covered by an oblong dark spot darkened at
the edges, where it is bordered by silvery white <a href="#f282-4.png">(fig. 283)</a>. The
middle is lighter, with a central dark stripe. In some individuals
the dark markings are broken up into four pairs of black spots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
partly connected with a middle line <a href="#f282-4.png">(fig. 282)</a>. The head is
wider and the eyes smaller and farther apart than in the other
species, and the front middle eyes are
the smallest. The head is wider in
males <a href="#f282-4.png">(fig. 284)</a> than in females, and
the mandibles larger. It lives under
stones and leaves at all seasons and
occasionally on bushes.</p>

</div>


<p><b>Steatoda corollata.</b>&mdash;This, when full
grown, is a little larger than <i>marmorata</i>
and darker colored, and the legs
are shorter and stouter. The cephalothorax
is dark brown, and the legs
lighter brown, with dark rings at the
ends of the joints. The abdomen is
yellowish at the sides and has four or
five irregular yellow spots, or pairs of spots, along the middle
of a dark brown oval patch which nearly covers the middle of
the back. In young specimens the abdomen is lighter, with
several pairs of dark spots. The eyes
are all nearly the same size, the front
middle pair slightly larger and farther
forward than the others. It lives under
stones, like the other species.</p>

<p><b>Steatoda triangulosa.</b>&mdash;The female is a
fifth of an inch to a quarter of an inch
long. The legs are longer and more
slender than in the other species, the
first pair twice as long as the body.
The cephalothorax is orange brown,
slightly rough in females and with short
ridges at the base of the hairs in males. The front middle eyes
are not larger than the others and are not as far forward as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
<i>borealis</i>. The legs are light yellow, with slightly darker rings
at the ends of the joints. There are thickened brown spots at
the base of the hairs all over the body. The abdomen is light
yellow, with two irregular brown stripes partly
broken into spots and sometimes connected
together <a href="#f285-6.png">(fig. 286)</a>. The palpi of the male are
as long as the femur of the second legs and
are small at the end. This spider lives in
houses, around
window frames
and similar
places, like <i>borealis</i>.
The egg
cocoons are
white and hang in the web.</p>

</div>



<p><b>Asagena americana.</b>&mdash;This resembles
Steatoda, but the abdomen
is longer and flatter, and
the whole appearance more like
some of the Drassid&aelig;. Like
Steatoda, it is usually found
with its web under stones. It
is about a sixth of an inch long.
The cephalothorax is dark reddish
brown, slightly rough in the
females and with sharp points
along the sides in the males.
The legs are yellow brown and
in the males have two rows of
small teeth under each femur.
They are stout, as in <i>Steatoda
marmorata</i>, and differ little in length. The abdomen is oval
and dark brown in color, with two white spots across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
middle <a href="#f287.png">(fig. 287)</a>. The front of the head is rounded and a
third as wide as the thorax. The eyes are close together and
all about the same size. The males have the cephalothorax
larger and rougher, but in size and color resemble the females.</p>

<p><b>Latrodectus mactans.</b>&mdash;This
is the largest spider
of the family. It is sometimes
half an inch long,
with the abdomen round
and the whole body black,
except a bright red spot
underneath and one or
more red spots over the
spinnerets and along the
middle of the back (figs. <a href="#f288-1.png">289, 290</a>). The spots turn
yellow or white in alcohol.
The cephalothorax is
about as wide as long, and
the grooves between the
head and thorax are deep.
The lateral eyes are
farther apart than usual in
this family. The legs of
the male are much larger
than those of the female,
and each joint is orange brown in the middle and black at the
ends. The abdomen of the male has a row of red and white spots
in the middle line, as some females do, and across the front end,
and along the sides four pairs of stripes, red in the middle
and white at the edges <a href="#f288-1.png">(fig. 291)</a>. The young of both sexes
are colored somewhat like the male and, when very small, have
very little black on them. The males vary much in size, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
being only a quarter as large as the female. This spider
makes its nest among loose stones, on plants, or in houses.
Around its hiding place it spins a large funnel-shaped tent
that widens into a flat or curved sheet of web, closer in
texture toward the tube and more open toward the edges,
spreading two or three feet over plants and stones. It is
found all over the United States, as far north as Massachusetts
and New Hampshire and south through Florida, the West
Indies, and South America, as far
as Chile. It is everywhere feared
as poisonous and dangerous, probably
on account of its large size
and conspicuous colors, as there is
no good reason for considering it
more poisonous than other spiders.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Argyrodes trigonum.</b>&mdash;A little yellow
triangular spider, with a high,
pointed abdomen <a href="#f292-5.png">(fig. 292)</a>. Large
females measure an eighth of an
inch from the head to the spinnerets
and nearly as much from
the spinnerets to the tip of the
abdomen. Seen from above, the
end of the abdomen is a little flattened
and notched in the middle <a href="#f292-5.png">(fig. 293)</a>. In the female
the part of the head around the eyes is slightly raised and the
lower part of the front of the head carried forward a little
beyond it <a href="#f292-5.png">(fig. 294)</a>. In the males there are two horns on the
head, one between the eyes and one below them <a href="#f292-5.png">(fig. 295)</a>.
The color is light yellow, sometimes with a metallic luster, as
though gilded. On the back of the cephalothorax are three
light brown stripes, and sometimes there are dark spots at
the sides of the abdomen and over the spinnerets. The legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
are slender, without markings, the front pair longer than the
others. The point of the abdomen is movable and is sometimes
curved downward when the spider is disturbed in the
web, as shown by the dotted line in <a href="#f292-5.png">fig. 292</a>. They make webs
like those of Theridium, between branches of shrubs <a href="#f296.png">(fig. 296)</a>
and also among the upper threads of the webs of larger spiders.
They have been found in the webs of
Agalena, Theridium, and Linyphia, in
the looser parts, out of reach of the
maker of the web. Hanging in the web,
they look like straws or the scales of
pine buds that have fallen into it. The
cocoons of eggs hang in the web and
have a peculiar shape <a href="#f296.png">(fig. 296)</a>, the
upper part conical and the lower
part contracted into a narrow neck.
The species is common in New
England and is found all over the
country as far south as Florida.</p>

as large as <i>Argyrodes trigonum</i>,
with the hump silver white and
the under side of the body black
or dark brown <a href="#f297-9.png">(fig. 297)</a>. The
hump ends in a blunt round point.
The front of the head is more nearly vertical than in <i>trigonum</i>,
and the upper part projects forward, carrying with it the front
middle eyes. In the male there are two horns in front of the
eyes, the upper one carrying the middle eyes of both rows
<a href="#f297-9.png">(fig. 299)</a>. The cephalothorax is black or dark brown above
and below. The abdomen is black on the under side, including
the spinnerets, and there is a black middle stripe extending
back to the tip of the hump. The basal joints of all the legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
are white. The third and fourth legs are light colored, with a
little brown at the ends of the joints. The second legs are
darker, and the first pair are almost black, except at the ends.
The males are colored like the females, but have the abdomen
not much larger than the cephalothorax <a href="#f297-9.png">(fig. 298)</a>, and the hump
rounded. This is a southern species and is said to live among
the outer threads of webs of large Epeirid&aelig;. It does, however,
make webs of its own, and I have seen the adults of both sexes
at Charleston, S.C., in these webs away from any other spiders.</p>

<p><b>Argyrodes fictilium.</b>&mdash;In this species the pointed hump on the
abdomen is much more elongated than in <i>trigonum</i>, in some
spiders to eight or nine times the length of the cephalothorax
<a href="#f300-1.png">(fig. 300)</a>. The tip is rounded in young specimens and sharp
pointed in the larger ones. The front of the head is more
inclined than that of <i>trigonum</i> <a href="#f300-1.png">(fig. 301)</a>. The colors are light
yellow and silvery white, with three darker lines on the cephalothorax
and a faint middle line on the abdomen. The legs are
very slender and long in proportion to the long abdomen.
Found rarely from New England to Alabama.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Spintharus flavidus.</b>&mdash;A sixth to a quarter of an inch long.
The cephalothorax is nearly circular, and the head small and
narrow like that of Argyrodes, with the hinder
middle eyes very far apart. The abdomen is
widest across the front third, where it is two
thirds as wide as it is long, and from here it
tapers to a blunt point over the spinnerets
<a href="#f302.png">(fig. 302)</a>. On the back the abdomen is flat
and marked with white stripes each side, and
between them a large pattern in
black and red, lighter toward the
middle, where there are two or
three pairs of white spots. The
legs are slender like those of
Argyrodes, the first and fourth
pairs the same length and twice
as long as the second pair. The
tibi&aelig; of the first and second legs
are bright orange color, and the
rest, like the cephalothorax, pale
yellow. The male has longer legs and more
slender abdomen. They live on low plants, and
the web is unknown. They have been found
from Massachusetts to Alabama.</p>

<p><b>Euryopis funebris.</b>&mdash;A little dark-colored spider,
with a flat abdomen pointed behind and bordered
with a silver-white stripe. It is almost
an eighth of an inch long. The cephalothorax
is small and as wide as it is long, with the sides
rounded. The head is half as wide as the thorax,
a little raised and extended forward over the mandibles <a href="#f303.png">(fig. 303)</a>.
The front middle eyes are largest and are farther apart and
farther forward than the others. The abdomen is flat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
nearly as wide in the middle as it is long, and tapers to a point
behind. The general color is black or dark gray. The cephalothorax
is yellowish under the abdomen and black in front. The
abdomen has a bright silvery stripe around the hinder half,
and inside this the color is black, broken by light spots in the
middle. The legs and palpi are light yellow, with dark rings on
the ends of the joints. The fourth
legs are longest. It is shaken
from bushes in summer, or from
dead leaves on the ground in
winter, and its web is unknown.
It is found from the White

<p><b>Pholcus phalangioides.</b>&mdash;This is a large pale spider, with legs
so long that it is often confounded with Phalangium, under the
nickname of "daddy longlegs." The body is quarter of an
inch long, and the longest legs two inches. The abdomen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
about three times as long as wide and nearly straight at the
sides unless full of eggs. The cephalothorax is nearly round
and flat behind. Around the eyes the head is raised and in
the males separated at the sides from the rest of the head.
The middle pair of eyes are not higher than the tops of the
lower lateral eyes. The mandibles are nearly as high as the
front of the head, and in the males they have a small conical
tooth near the base. The color is pale brown, covered with
fine gray hairs, and the whole body and legs are translucent.
The head is a little darker
around the eyes, and there
is a large gray patch in the
middle of the cephalothorax.
The abdomen is marked only
by a translucent middle line
over the dorsal vessel. This
is a house spider, common
in America and Europe, and
probably imported. It lives
in cellars where there is but
little light and makes large,
loose, flat webs, horizontal
where there is a convenient
place, or irregular to fit into
surrounding objects <a href="#f308.jpg">(fig. 308)</a>.
The spider hangs in the web
with the abdomen directed
upward, and when alarmed
swings itself around rapidly
so that it can hardly be seen.
The egg cocoon is so thin that it does not conceal the eggs
and is carried about in the spider's mandibles until the young
hatch out.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Pholcus cornutus.</b>&mdash;A small species from the southern states,
with a body about a tenth of an inch long and the legs from
half to three-quarters of an inch. The abdomen is humped on
the back and short on the under side, so that seen from the side
it is nearly triangular <a href="#f309-1.png">(fig. 309)</a>. The cephalothorax is as wide
as long and nearly circular. The head is small and marked by
a shallow groove on each side. In front it is higher than wide
and inclined a little forward toward the mandibles. The eyes
<a href="#f309-1.png">(fig. 310)</a> are raised a little from the head, three large eyes
almost touching each other in a group on each side, and a small
pair between them just above the lower eyes of the larger
groups. The mandibles are three-quarters as high as the head,
with a small tooth on the inner corners and, in the males, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
long curved horn projecting forward near the base of each
mandible <a href="#f309-1.png">(fig. 311)</a>. The legs are very slender and transparent,
slightly colored brown, with
darker rings at the ends of the femur
and tibia. There is a dark mark
around the eyes and head, forming
behind them a middle line that widens
toward the hinder end of the cephalothorax.
The abdomen is gray, marked
on the upper side with three or four
pairs of darker spots and behind with
lighter spots, somewhat like <i>Theridium
tepidariorum</i>.</p>

<p><b>Scytodes
thoracica.</b>&mdash;This
is a very
peculiar
spider, probably
imported
from Europe, and found
in cellars and closets. It is about quarter of an
inch long when full grown. The cephalothorax
and abdomen are both round and nearly of the
same size. The cephalothorax is low and narrow
in front and slopes upward to the highest
point opposite the third legs <a href="#f312-3.png">(fig. 313)</a>, and from
there falls abruptly behind. The eyes are six in
number, in three pairs, the middle pair lowest
and the lateral pairs wide apart at the sides of
the head <a href="#f312-3.png">(fig. 312)</a>. The front of the
head below the eyes projects forward
beyond the mandibles. The legs are
slender and tapering, the tarsus and metatarsus not more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
half as thick as the tibia. The color is pale yellow or white,
with black or gray spots, in a regular pattern on the cephalothorax
and abdomen, and in rings on the legs.</p>

<p><b>Mimetus interfector.</b>&mdash;This is about the
same size and color as <i>Theridium tepidariorum</i>,
but it has a round and Epeira-like
abdomen and spiny legs like Epeira or
Linyphia. The length is nearly a quarter
of an inch. The cephalothorax is one and
a half times as long as wide, widest behind
and narrow in front <a href="#f314-5.png">(fig. 314)</a>. The mandibles
are long and dark colored, except
a spot near the base. The cephalothorax
is whitish, with a stripe of brown from
the eyes to the dorsal groove. The abdomen
is small, widest in front, like that of
<i>Epeira angulata</i>, with two prominent corners.
The markings are also like Epeira,&mdash;a
central stripe, with dark spots along
the edges (figs. <a href="#f314-5.png">314, 315</a>). The color is
gray and brown in the darker parts. The
legs are light yellow, with dark rings at
the ends of
the joints.
It lives on
bushes and
occasionally on houses and fences,
where it has been found in webs
among those of <i>Theridium tepidariorum</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ero thoracica.</b>&mdash;This spider resembles
the young of <i>Theridium tepidariorum</i>, but the colors are
brighter, and the hairs longer and coarser. It is an eighth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
a sixth of an inch long. The cephalothorax is nearly as high
in the middle as it is long and slopes at a sharp angle under
the front of the abdomen <a href="#f316-7.png">(fig. 317)</a>. The head is lower than the
middle of the thorax, and the front middle eyes project beyond
the mandibles. The abdomen is as high as long and has a pair
of humps on the highest part. The cephalothorax is light
yellow, with a dark irregular stripe on each side and a middle
line crossed by a crescent-shaped mark on the highest part.
The abdomen is white, with brown spots of various shapes.
The front half of each hump is dark brown, and a dark line
extends from there down the sides <a href="#f316-7.png">(fig. 316)</a>. At the back of
the abdomen are several transverse stripes, which are sometimes
reddish. Stiff brown hairs are scattered all over the
abdomen. The legs are ringed with brown and yellow, and
have coarse brown hairs and long spines on the tibia and tarsus,
which is unusual in this family. It is found under stones and
in winter under leaves in woods. It lives also in Europe.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE LINYPHIAD&AElig;</h2>


<p>The Linyphiad&aelig; consist of a great number of species of small
spiders living, for the most part, in shady woods, among the
lower branches of plants, under leaves, and in caves and cellars.
They differ from the Theridid&aelig; generally in having the body
more elongated, the legs stouter and with more spines, the
mandibles larger and stronger and furnished with teeth around
the claw, and the maxill&aelig; straighter and not inclined inward
toward the labium. There are two groups among them,&mdash;Linyphia
and its allies, which are comparatively large and some of
which live in the open woods, with large cobwebs, and Erigone
and its allies, which are all very small spiders, living mostly in
short grass, dead leaves, and moss. The latter usually have
narrower bodies and stouter legs, resembling the Drassid&aelig;.
Their colors are generally plain and dull, and the females are
difficult to distinguish from each other, while the males often
have peculiar modifications of the head and proportionally very
large and complicated palpi.</p>

<p>The webs usually have a large flat sheet, supported by threads
above and below, under which the spider lives. Some species
have the sheet of web curved upward or downward. <i>Linyphia
marginata</i> forms a dome-shaped web four or five inches in
diameter.</p>


<h3>THE GENUS LINYPHIA</h3>

<p>These spiders vary in size like the species of Theridium, from
a quarter of an inch to a tenth of an inch long. In appearance
they differ greatly from Theridium; the cephalothorax is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
longer and higher in front, the legs are long and slender, with
distinct spines, and the abdomen is sometimes a little flattened
on the back as in Steatoda, but oftener high in front and a little
pointed toward the spinnerets. The sexes differ little in size,
but often in color and markings. The palpal organs and the
terminal joints of the palpi of the males are very large and
complicated, and in the smaller species form the best means of
distinguishing them. There are a great number of minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
species of Microneta, Bathyphantes, and other allied genera,
but only the larger and more common are here described.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 321.</span> Beginning of a web of Linyphia marginata.</span>
</div>


<p><b>Linyphia marginata.</b>&mdash;This is one of the most common web
spiders in shady woods all through the summer. It is a sixth
of an inch long, with slender legs, the longest of which are
usually half an inch. The cephalothorax is two-thirds as wide
as long, the middle of it brown and the
edges light. The abdomen is flat on top
and widest and thickest behind, the colors
light yellow and purplish brown <a href="#f319-0.png">(fig. 319)</a>.
In the middle there is a dark stripe, consisting
usually of three parts united by a
narrow line, and behind this is another
dark spot. At the sides are several dark
stripes, the front ones lengthwise and the
hinder vertical, all connected with the dark
color of the under side. The legs are
light yellow without markings, and the
hairs and spines fine and not easily seen.
In the males all the colors are darker and
the abdomen narrower, with only a few
light marks at the sides. This spider has
no nest, but lives all the time in the
middle of its web. It matures in June, and
the young brood are common in their
small webs in August and September.</p>


<p>The web of <i>L. marginata</i> <a href="#f318.jpg">(fig. 318)</a> is in the form of a dome
four or five inches in diameter, hung between rocks and plants,
seldom much concealed by leaves. The threads are fine, and
the web so transparent that it easily escapes notice unless
the sun shines upon it. The meshes are larger than in <i>L. phrygiana</i>
and other flat web-making species. The depth and width
of the dome depend somewhat on the shape of the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
in which it is made, and the number and length of the supporting
threads vary according to the surroundings. The
spider stands apparently all the time under the top of the
dome. Insects flying near touch the threads above the dome
and, their flight being broken, drop down among closer threads
and, finally, to the dome itself, where they are caught by the
spider and taken through the meshes. Remains of insects and
other rubbish are cut loose from the web and dropped. The
webs seem to be used for a long time, but if they are injured
a new one is soon made, either in the night or day, and the
remains of several old webs are often seen hanging flat and
torn below a new one. The dome is begun at the top and
extended downward by inclined threads, an inch or two long,
which are crossed by shorter threads in all directions <a href="#f321.jpg">(fig. 321)</a>.
The spider works very rapidly, but I have never seen a dome
finished, the spider always working a few minutes and then
resting a long time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Linyphia communis.</b>&mdash;A little smaller than <i>marginata</i>, with
legs a little shorter. The colors are the same light yellow and
purplish brown, but the markings are distinctly different. The
cephalothorax is uniform light brownish yellow. The middle
stripe of the abdomen extends the whole length of the upper
side and connects with several narrow brown stripes that extend
down the sides <a href="#f323-4.png">(fig. 323)</a>. The abdomen is more regularly oval
and less enlarged behind than in <i>marginata</i>, but the upper part
extends back farther over the spinnerets. The under side is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
dark brown. The male is smaller than the female, with the
head higher and the abdomen narrower. The palpi of the
male are unusually small for the genus <a href="#f323-4.png">(fig. 324)</a>. The web of
<i>communis</i> <a href="#f322.jpg">(fig. 322)</a> consists of a horizontal sheet, convex below
and supported by threads above. Below this, about an inch
distant, is another sheet of web. Insects flying between the
upper threads fall down to the sheet below and are taken
through by the spider, as they
are in the dome of <i>marginata</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Linyphia mandibulata.</b>&mdash;A little
larger than <i>L. communis</i> and
<i>marginata</i>, with the head longer
and more distinct from the
thorax, and the abdomen larger
and flattened on the top (figs. <a href="#f326-9.png">326, 327</a>). The length is about
a sixth of an inch. The cephalothorax is dark
orange brown, and the legs a lighter shade of the
same color. The length of the legs is about as in
<i>communis</i>, shorter than <i>marginata</i> and <i>phrygiana</i>.
The abdomen is dark brown, often almost black,
with several white spots, usually two across the front end and
several others around the sides <a href="#f326-9.png">(fig. 326)</a>, sometimes forming a
complete light stripe around the middle. In the males the
abdomen is narrow, and the only markings are usually the two
spots on the front end. The cephalothorax of the male is long
and narrow; the head is extended forward, and the mandibles
inclined backward toward the maxill&aelig;. The mandibles are
more than half as long as the cephalothorax and widened at the
ends, with four teeth on the inner corner <a href="#f326-9.png">(fig. 329)</a>. On the inner
side of the mandibles, near the middle, is a large blunt tooth.</p>

<p>The webs are flat and near the ground, on short grass and
leaves and across little hollows in the sod <a href="#f325.jpg">(fig. 325)</a>. The webs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
are not as large as those of <i>phrygiana</i>, and the spider has no
nest, but stands always in the web and drops suddenly when
alarmed. It lives all over the eastern part of the country and
resembles closely the <i>Linyphia pusilla</i> of Europe.</p>

<p><b>Linyphia coccinea.</b>&mdash;About a sixth of an inch long and bright
red and orange color. The size and length of legs are about
the same as in <i>communis</i>. The legs are light orange, the
cephalothorax a deeper shade of the same color, and the abdomen
light red. The palpi have the ends black, and the legs
are sometimes streaked with black. The hinder middle eyes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
twice as large as
the others and
twice as far apart
as the front middle
pair. The space
between and
around the middle
eyes is black. The
top of the abdomen
is a little flattened
and extended
back in a blunt
black point over
the spinnerets <a href="#f330-1.png">(fig. 330)</a>. The male
<a href="#f330-1.png">(fig. 331)</a> differs little
from the female
except in the more
slender abdomen
and longer legs.
The male palpi are
as long as those of the female and only a little thickened at the
ends. The blackened point on the end of the abdomen is less
distinct in the male than the female.
The web is a little concave, not as
deep as that of <i>marginata</i> and with
smaller meshes. It is made among
low plants. This is a common
species in the South.</p>

and <i>communis</i>, measuring a fifth of an inch in length. The
cephalothorax is light yellow, with a black line in the middle,
forked at the front end, and another at the sides near the edge
of the thorax. The legs are light yellow, with a dark ring at
the end of each joint and at the middle of each tibia and metatarsus.
The legs are also marked with dark spots, especially
on the femora, and the spines are black and conspicuous. The
abdomen is yellowish, with brown spots at the sides and beneath,
and along the middle of the back is a dark brown or red herringbone
stripe <a href="#f333-4.png">(fig. 333)</a>. The head of the male is higher than
that of the female and has a crest of stiff hairs. The male palpi
<a href="#f333-4.png">(fig. 334)</a> have a long spur on the patella and have the end small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
like <i>communis</i>. The web <a href="#f332.jpg">(fig. 332)</a> is a large flat sheet, sometimes
over a foot across. A corner of it usually runs under a
stone or other hiding place, and here the spider stands, often
making a little tent in connection with the web.</p>

<p><b>Linyphia (Bathyphantes) nebulosa.</b>&mdash;Length a
sixth of an inch. Color light brownish yellow,
with gray markings <a href="#f336-8.png">(fig. 338)</a>. Some are
almost white, and others are dark, with the
black spots covering a large part of the body.
The cephalothorax is dark on the edges and
has a dark middle stripe, forked toward the
eyes. The abdomen has six or seven pairs of
irregular dark spots, more or less connected with a dark middle
line. The under side of abdomen and sternum have black spots
which, in dark individuals, run together, making these parts
entirely black. The legs have dark rings on the ends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
middle of the femora
and tibi&aelig;. The spines
are long and darker than
the skin. The epigynum
is folded twice, so
that only part of it is seen extending
out from the under side
of the abdomen (figs. <a href="#f339-1.png">340, 341</a>).
The palpus of the male <a href="#f339-1.png">(fig. 339)</a> has large and complicated
appendages at the end. In
general shape it is rounder than
in the next species, and the
angle at the base of the tarsus
is less prominent. This spider
is common in cellars and other damp and shady
places about houses. It is common in Europe and is perhaps
imported. The web is flat,
like that of <i>L. phrygiana</i>, and
often large for the size of the
spider, sometimes covering a
pail or box a foot wide.</p>

<p><b>Linyphia (Bathyphantes) minuta.</b>&mdash;One-eighth
of an inch long,
a little smaller than <i>nebulosa</i>.
The cephalothorax is yellowish
brown, darker at
the edges, but without any
middle line. The dark
markings of the abdomen
nearly cover it, so that it
appears dark gray with
light markings instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
light with dark markings,
as in <i>nebulosa</i>. The
legs are light brownish
yellow, with dark rings
on the ends and middle
of the femora and tibi&aelig;.
The epigynum is folded twice, as in <i>nebulosa</i>
<a href="#f342-4.png">(fig. 343)</a>. The male palpi <a href="#f342-4.png">(fig. 344)</a>
have a general resemblance to those of
<i>nebulosa</i>, but there are some distinct
differences. The tarsal hook is very
large and has a longer and narrower
point than <i>nebulosa</i>. The tarsus has on
the outer side near the base a conical
point roughened with short ridges. This
is more prominent in this species than in
<i>nebulosa</i>. It lives in cellars and similar
places often in company with <i>nebulosa</i>.</p>

<p><b>Linyphia (Drapetisca) socialis.</b>&mdash;This very
distinct species is marked with gray and
white and is often found on
the bark of trees without any
web. It is a tenth to an eighth
of an inch in length. The
cephalothorax is white with
black edges, a black spot in
front under the eyes, and a
black mark in the middle, from
which indistinct lines radiate
toward the edge. The abdomen
is widest just behind the
middle <a href="#f345-7.png">(fig. 345)</a>. It is white,
mottled with gray, and has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
black stripe on each side and several pairs of black spots in the
middle, connected with a middle line. The legs are white, with
a gray ring at the end and middle of
each joint. The spines are long on the
legs and palpi <a href="#f345-7.png">(fig. 347)</a>. The mandibles
have an oblique dark stripe and
several long hairs in front and a row
of teeth in front of the claw. The
epigynum <a href="#f345-7.png">(fig. 346)</a> is large and extends
obliquely backward away from
the abdomen and curves inward again
at the end. It lives all over the
northern part of this country and
Europe, under leaves and sometimes
on trees, where it is occasionally found
on the bark without any web.</p>

light yellow, and the abdomen gray or white, sometimes
without markings and sometimes
with gray stripes at the sides and two
or three pairs of gray
marks across the hinder
half <a href="#f348-0.png">(fig. 348)</a>. The cephalothorax
of the male is

<a href="#f348-0.png">(fig. 350)</a> is long and
straight, extending backward
close to the abdomen for half its length. The tibia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of the palpal organ has a short, pointed process, extending
directly outward from the side <a href="#f348-0.png">(fig. 348)</a>. They live in flat
webs among low plants.</p>

<p><b>Linyphia (Diplostyla) concolor.</b>&mdash;About a twelfth of an inch
long, a little smaller than <i>nigrina</i>, with long slender legs, and
the abdomen slightly pointed toward the spinnerets and not
much larger than the cephalothorax. The color is light yellow
brown, the abdomen gray without any markings. The epigynum
(figs. <a href="#f351-3.png">352, 353</a>) has a long, slender, flexible process on the
outer edge that extends backward to the middle of the abdomen,
and under it is another shorter one not easily seen. The
tarsus of the male palpus <a href="#f351-3.png">(fig. 351)</a> is longer and more tapering
than that of <i>nigrina</i>. Adults of both sexes are common under
leaves in winter all over the northern part of the country.</p>

<p>The Erigones are all very small spiders, and for this reason
few of them will be described. They live, for the most part,
near the ground in grass, moss, and dead leaves, with small
webs like those of Linyphia, and are seldom seen unless carefully
searched for. There is one season of the year, however,
when the Erigones appear in immense numbers. This is
during the fine weather that comes after the first frosts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
October and November, when they, in company with the
young of many larger kinds of spiders, come to the tops of
posts and fences and, turning their spinnerets upward, allow
threads to be drawn out by ascending currents of air, until
sometimes the
spiders are lifted
off their feet and
carried long distances.
Though
not so easily seen,
the same performance
is going on at
the tops of grass
and bushes, and at
times the whole
country is covered
with threads of silk,
and the threads in
the air tangle together
into flakes,
which at length
fall, sometimes from great heights. This appearance is called
in England "gossamer" and in Germany the "flying summer"
and the "old woman's summer." Why the spiders spin the
thread and what use it is to them to be blown about are
unknown. At the time of the autumn flights great numbers
of these spiders may be seen on fences and doorsteps in city
streets wherever there is a neighboring park or grass plat, and
the spiders probably live the rest of the year among this grass
near the ground.</p>

<p><b>Erigone longipalpis</b> and <b>dentigera.</b>&mdash;These spiders are a tenth
of an inch to a twentieth of an inch long and generally dark
brown in color, with the cephalothorax smooth and shining.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
In some, especially the larger males, the cephalothorax is
bright orange and the legs partly of the same color. The
females vary considerably in size, but are otherwise much alike.
The peculiarities are in the males.
The head is about half the length of
the cephalothorax and abruptly raised
and rounded on the top <a href="#f361-5.png">(fig. 361)</a>.
Along the sides of the thorax are
small pointed teeth of various sizes
in a single irregular row <a href="#f361-5.png">(fig. 362)</a>.
The mandibles are very much thickened
in the middle and have a row of
teeth on the front outer side <a href="#f361-5.png">(fig. 364)</a>.
The palpi of the males are sometimes
as long as the whole body and of a
complicated shape. The femur is
curved upward and forward and has
a row of little teeth on the under side.
The patella and tibia are together
about as long as the femur. The
patella has at the end a straight tooth
directed downward with a short point
<a href="#f361-5.png">(fig. 361)</a>. The tibia is widened at the
end, where it spreads around the base
of the tarsus. The maxill&aelig; are much
thickened and the bases of the palpi
spread wide apart <a href="#f361-5.png">(fig. 365)</a>. The
palpi are usually carried doubled up in front of the head, with
the curved ends of the femora just below the eyes and the palpal
organs over the ends of the mandibles. The legs of Erigone
are only moderately long, and they walk easily, like the small
Drassid&aelig;. They move slowly and are not easily frightened, so
that at the time of flying they can be closely watched.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><b>Erigone autumnalis.</b>&mdash;This is one of the few species of Erigone
that can be distinctly separated from the others. It lives
in the same places and is found with <i>longipalpis</i>
in the autumn flights. It is only a twentieth of
an inch long, but can be distinguished
by its light color and bright yellow
head. The palpi of the males have
the tibia shorter than the patella and
the tooth on the patella turned more
forward than in <i>longipalpis</i>, with a
longer and sharper point tapering
from the base to the tip <a href="#f366-7.png">(fig. 367)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ceratinella l&aelig;tabilis.</b>&mdash;This is about
the same size as <i>fissiceps</i>,&mdash;a sixteenth
of an inch long,&mdash;but much
darker colored, and the males do not
have horns or humps on the head.
The cephalothorax and sternum are dark
brown, and the legs dark orange. The thickened
circle on the abdomen <a href="#f368-0.png">(fig. 368)</a> is dark
orange brown and the thinner
parts gray. In the female the
thick circle is usually wanting
and the whole abdomen dark
gray, with lighter spots around
the muscular marks. There are
also hardened spots around the
stem of the abdomen and under
the spinnerets in both sexes.
The head is slightly elevated
behind the eyes, a little more
in the male than in the female.
The male palpi (figs. <a href="#f368-0.png">369, 370</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
are shorter and stouter than those of <i>fissiceps</i>. It lives in dead
leaves and moss, sometimes under stones, and is sometimes
found flying in the autumn.</p>

</div>


<p><b>Ceratinella fissiceps.</b>&mdash;These little spiders are
among the smallest species,
measuring only a sixteenth of an
inch in length. The cephalothorax
and abdomen are short and
round, and the abdomen has a
round thickened spot on the back,
more deeply orange colored than
the part around it. The head is
black around the eyes, and a black
line extends backward half the
length of the cephalothorax. The
head of the male extends forward
over the mandibles, carrying with
it the front middle eyes, and above it is a rounded hump with
the hind middle eyes. The
pairs of lateral eyes are
opposite the crease between
the humps (figs. <a href="#f371-3.png">371</a>). The
female has at the same point
a slight crease across the
head and an elevation before
and behind it. They are
very common on low bushes
in summer and under leaves
in winter, and are occasionally
seen in the autumn
flights.</p>

<p><b>Cornicularia directa.</b>&mdash;The
males and females are of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
same size and about a twelfth of an inch long. The cephalothorax
is brown, varying in different individuals. The abdomen
is gray, with the muscular spots lighter than the rest. The
cephalothorax is long, narrowing gradually toward the head.
In the males there is a slender horn extending forward between
the eyes, a little thickened at the end and covered on the upper
side with stiff hairs in rows <a href="#f374-6.png">(fig. 376)</a>. Under this horn is a
smaller one about half as long and close against it <a href="#f374-6.png">(fig. 375)</a>.
In females the horns
are absent, but the shape
of the head and arrangement
of the eyes are the
same, except that the
eyes are closer together.
There are several other species of Cornicularia,
some with similar horns and others
with single horns on the heads of the
males. They are found under leaves in
winter, on plants and fences, and among
the flying spiders in autumn.</p>

length of the mandibles, and in males it is greater. The size of
the sexes is about the same. The upper middle eyes are a little
larger and farther apart than the front middle pair, and between
them is a flattened space covered with stiff black hairs, longer
in the male than in the female <a href="#f377-8.png">(fig. 377)</a>. The male palpi have
the femur as thick as the femur of the first leg and the tibia
very short and wide, with a little recurved point on the front
edge. They live on low bushes in summer and under leaves
in winter.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE EPEIRID&AElig;</h2>


<p>The Epeirid&aelig; are the makers of the familiar round cobwebs.
Like the Theridid&aelig; and the Linyphiad&aelig;, they live always in
their webs or nests back downward or, when in the round web,
head downward. The cephalothorax is generally short, as in
Theridid&aelig;, and low and wide in front, with the eyes near the
front edge, the lateral pairs close together and farther from
the middle eyes than the latter are from each other. The
mandibles are large and strong. The maxill&aelig; are short, often
as short as wide, and parallel or a little divergent and rounded
at the ends, never pointed or turned inward. The labium is
shorter than wide and rounded or slightly pointed at the end.
The legs are usually long and, more commonly than in the
other cobweb spiders, stout and furnished with spines.</p>

<p>Most of the common species belong to the genus Epeira
and its allies, having rounded abdomens and stout legs, some
of them with humps and spines and peculiar angular forms of
the abdomen. The colors are often bright, and those of the
abdomen arranged in a triangular or leaf-shaped pattern. In
Meta (p. <a href="#Page_190">190</a>) and Argyroepeira (p. <a href="#Page_191">191</a>) the abdomen is more
elongated and the form and marking more like Linyphia. In
Tetragnatha (p. <a href="#Page_201">201</a>) the whole body is long and slender, the
abdomen several times as long as the cephalothorax, and the
maxill&aelig; and mandibles, especially in the males, much elongated.
The colors are more uniform and the markings faint, usually
light gray, yellow, or green, like the plants among which they
live. The round webs of the Epeirid&aelig; consist of a number
of radiating lines, varying in different species from a dozen to
seventy, crossed by two spirals,&mdash;an inner spiral that begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
in the center and winds outward, and an outer spiral that begins
at the edge of the web and winds inward. The inner spiral is
made of smooth thread like the rays, and dust will not stick
to it. The outer spiral is made of more elastic and sticky
thread, which, when it is fresh, is covered with fine drops of
a sticky liquid. In the finished web (figs. <a href="#f379.jpg">379</a>,
<a href="#f380.jpg">380</a>) the outer spiral covers three-quarters or more of the diameter and the
inner spiral a quarter or less, but in the unfinished web <a href="#f381.jpg">(fig. 381)</a>,
before the sticky thread is put in, the inner spiral covers nearly
the whole of it and is cut out, piece by piece, to make room for
the outer spiral.</p>

</div>

<p>In beginning a web, after the radiating threads are finished,
the spider fastens them more firmly at the center and corrects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the distances between them by several short, irregular threads
<a href="#f379.jpg">(fig. 379)</a> and then begins the inner spiral with the turns, at first
close together and then widening, in some species gradually, in
others suddenly, until they are as far apart as the spider can
reach with the spinnerets on one and the front feet on the next,
and so goes on nearly to the outside of the web, where it stops
abruptly <a href="#f381.jpg">(fig. 381)</a>. The spider usually rests a moment and
then begins, sometimes at another part of the web, the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
sticky spiral. In the outermost parts of the web it usually
forms several loops <a href="#f381.jpg">(fig. 381, <i>b</i> to <i>f</i>)</a>, filling in the corners until
it approaches the inner spiral and finds room to pass completely
around the web. As soon as the inner spiral is found in the
way a part of it is cut out, and by the time the outer spiral is
finished the inner is reduced to the small and close portion
near the center.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>While the temporary spirals are made as far apart as possible,
the threads of the outer spiral are placed as close together as
they can be without danger of their sticking to each other,
and usually a little closer together toward the center of the
web than they are at the outside. In fastening this thread to
the rays of the web the spider first feels for the last thread
with the first and second feet, and, having found it, turns the
body slightly around and grasps the ray with the nearest foot
of the fourth pair at a short distance from the point where the
last thread crosses. After taking hold of the ray with the
fourth foot, the spider turns down the abdomen so as to place
the spinnerets against the ray and fastens the thread to it, at
the same time holding the thread off with the other fourth foot
to prevent its sticking to anything around it. The whole
making of the web seems to be done entirely by feeling and
is done as well in the dark as in daylight.</p>

<p>When the spider is active and the food supply good, a
fresh web is made every day, the old one being torn down and
thrown away. In tearing down a web <a href="#f382.jpg">(fig. 382)</a> the spider
walks out from the center on one of the rays and gathers in
what web he can reach with the front feet, chews it into a
ball, and drops it; then, having put in new rays in the
cleared space, he goes to another part of the web and tears
down another piece.</p>

<p>The variations between the webs of different species are
chiefly in the central portion. In the webs of <i>hortorum</i>
(p. <a href="#Page_191">19</a>), <i>gibberosa</i> (p. <a href="#Page_177">177</a>), and <i>placida</i>
 (p. <a href="#Page_178">178</a>), which spend
most of their time in the web, the close part of the inner spiral
is very large, circular, and finely finished, usually showing no
trace of the wide temporary spirals. The number of rays is
very large, and there is a wide clear space between the inner
and outer spirals. In Argiope the inner spiral is very large
and widens gradually until it almost touches the outer spiral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
It has a closely woven mat in the center and two zigzag bands
of white silk extending up and down.</p>

<p>The webs of Tetragnatha, Meta, and Acrosoma have a hole
in the middle, the irregular center being entirely removed.
<i>Insularis</i> and <i>trifolium</i> live always in tent-shaped nests, with a
thread, or several threads, leading to the center of the web.
<i>Globosa</i>, <i>labyrinthea</i>, and Zilla have a similar thread from
nest to web, and leave open a segment of the web through
which it passes.</p>

<p>Insects flying through the web strike the sticky threads
and, trying to free themselves, fall against others. The spider
at the center of the web feels the movements of the insect
and goes toward it by the nearest ray and, drawing out silk
from the spinnerets, throws it around the insect until it is tied
fast. Adult male Epeirid&aelig; are seldom seen in webs of their
own, but some of them do occasionally make webs. The male
<i>E. sclopetaria</i>, for instance, sometimes makes a web
nearly as large as that of the female and stands in it
waiting for insects to be caught.</p>

<p><b>The Three House Epeiras: E.
sclopetaria, patagiata,</b> and <b>strix.</b>&mdash;These
are the round-web
spiders most commonly found
about houses, barns, and
fences. They are all
about the same size, a
third of an inch in
length, and of various
shades of brown, with a
distinct scalloped middle
stripe on the abdomen.
<i>Sclopetaria</i> <a href="#f383-5.png">(fig. 383)</a> has the middle
stripe broken at the edges just in front of the middle of each
side, so as to form two separate figures, one covering the front
and the other the hinder half of the abdomen. In <i>patagiata</i>
<a href="#f383-5.png">(fig. 384)</a> and <i>strix</i> the edges of the stripe are usually entire
for their whole length. In <i>strix</i> <a href="#f383-5.png">(fig. 385)</a> the middle stripe
is narrower than in the others and usually lighter in color.
The color of <i>sclopetaria</i> inclines to black, with the light marks
yellow. <i>Patagiata</i> is oftener reddish brown, especially in
alcohol, and the middle stripe is often dark and uniform in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
color, less broken by spots and transverse marks than in the
others. The front legs of <i>sclopetaria</i> are longer than those
of the other species, and the front legs of <i>strix</i> shorter and
stouter. The cephalothorax of <i>strix</i> is more plainly marked
than the others, with three longitudinal stripes. There is
not much difference in the markings of the under side. The
epigynum has two hard brown prominences at each side, with
a soft finger-like appendage between. In <i>sclopetaria</i> and
<i>strix</i> this finger is slender and tapers slightly toward the end.
In <i>patagiata</i> it is wide at the end and flattened. In the
palpi of the males there is a similar difference. Those of
<i>sclopetaria</i> and <i>strix</i> are much alike, but that of <i>patagiata</i> has
the forked hook at the base much thicker and more curved.
<i>Patagiata</i> is a northern species, common in Canada and found
occasionally as far south as Massachusetts and New York. It
is also common in the north of Europe. <i>Sclopetaria</i> is also a
European species, and is seldom found far from houses. It is
more common north, but has been found as far south as Norfolk,
Va. <i>Strix</i> is common all over the country, both around
houses and in bushes.</p>

<p>The webs of these spiders have usually from twelve to twenty
rays, and the inner spiral is small and carelessly finished
(figs. <a href="#f379.jpg">379</a>, <a href="#f380.jpg">380</a>). The webs are made usually at nightfall,
very young individuals beginning to spin soon after sunset,
and larger ones beginning later, those that are full grown
often waiting until dark, but some of them will occasionally
spin their webs at any time of day. They stand in the web
during the night, but seldom during the daytime, going then
to their usual nests or hiding places, sometimes, especially
with <i>Epeira strix</i>, a long distance from the web. As a rule,
they have no special thread by which to enter or leave the
web, but use any one of the rays which may be convenient,
always injuring the web more or less; but occasionally, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<i>Epeira sclopetaria</i> has a nest in a convenient situation, he will
make the web near it and have a thread direct from the nest to
the center of the web, as is the usual habit in some other
species. The eggs of <i>sclopetaria</i> are laid in the early summer
in large, round, white cocoons <a href="#f386.jpg">(fig. 386)</a>, fastened in sheltered
places on the walls of houses and covered with a loose mass
of silk threads.</p>

<p><b>The Angulate Epeiras.</b>&mdash;<i>E. angulata</i> <a href="#f389-0.png">(fig. 389)</a>, <i>silvatica</i>
<a href="#f389-0.png">(fig. 390)</a>, <i>nordmanni</i> <a href="#f387-8.png">(fig. 387)</a>, <i>cinerea</i> <a href="#f391.png">(fig. 391)</a>, and <i>corticaria</i>
<a href="#f392.png">(fig. 392)</a> all have the humps on the front of the abdomen,
and in young spiders this is the widest part. <i>Angulata</i>,
<i>silvatica</i>, and <i>cinerea</i> grow to a large size. <i>Cinerea</i> is light
colored and lives in great numbers about houses and barns
in northern New England. <i>Angulata</i> and <i>silvatica</i> are found
among trees and are dark colored like bark. <i>Angulata</i> has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
yellow stripe on the sternum and yellow spots under the abdomen
between the spinnerets and epigynum. <i>Silvatica</i> has the sternum
and under side of the abdomen brown, without any distinct
markings. The male <i>angulata</i> has the thickened tibia of the
second leg nearly as long as the tibia of the first leg. The
male <i>silvatica</i> has the second tibia less thickened and a fourth
shorter than the first tibia. The male <i>angulata</i> has a pair of long
spines under the cox&aelig; of the second legs, but in <i>silvatica</i> these
spines are so small as to be hardly visible. <i>E. nordmanni</i> is a
smaller species, about as large as <i>sclopetaria</i> and <i>strix</i>, with
light gray colors and generally distinct marking both above
and below. <i>E. corticaria</i> is not more than half as large as
<i>silvatica</i> and might be mistaken for the young of that species,
but the colors are lighter and the rings on the legs narrower
and more numerous. The epigynum of <i>corticaria</i>
is nearly as large as that of <i>silvatica</i>,
and the middle appendage is often wanting as
if broken off.</p>

<p><b>Epeira nordmanni.</b>&mdash;This is a little smaller
and a little longer legged than <i>cinerea</i> and
<i>angulata</i>. The abdomen is longer than in
those species and has two similar humps in
front <a href="#f387-8.png">(fig. 387)</a>. The female is not more than
half an inch long. The colors are white and
gray or black. The cephalothorax is light
gray, darkest at the sides, but without stripes.
The legs have a dark ring at the ends and a
lighter one in the middle of each joint. The
abdomen has a distinct middle stripe on the
hinder half. In front there is an indistinct dark area extending
to the top of the humps and, in the middle, inclosing a bright,
long, white spot, with a round spot on each side sometimes
united with it. The sternum is dark brown, without any stripe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
The under side of the abdomen has a middle dark area in
which are four yellow spots, two just behind the respiratory
openings and two farther back, halfway to the spinnerets.</p>

<p><b>Epeira angulata</b> and <b>silvatica.</b>&mdash;These spiders, which are perhaps
varieties of the same species, live usually among large
trees and grow to over half an inch in length.
The abdomen has two slight humps on the
front. The colors are dark, like the bark of
trees. The cephalothorax is dark brown, with
traces of darker lines in the middle and at its
sides. The legs are brown, with darker rings
at the ends of the joints and less distinct rings
in the middle. The abdomen has a bright
yellow spot in front. The middle stripe is
darker brown than the rest and has a scalloped
edge marked by a dark and light line, which
may be entire or broken into lines of spots.
The under side of the abdomen is black or
brown, with sometimes several yellow spots.
The sternum is uniform brown in <i>silvatica</i>
and has a yellow middle stripe in <i>angulata</i>.
The males are colored like the females and
are about half as large, with the legs longer,
especially the front pairs. The tibia of the
second legs is twice as thick as that of the
first pair, a little bent, with the spines stouter
and more numerous than in the female. In the male of the
<i>angulata</i> variety the tibia of the second pair is nearly as long
as that of the first, but in <i>silvatica</i> it is distinctly shorter. On
the under side of the cox&aelig; of the second legs is a conical spine,
which is longest in the <i>angulata</i> variety. The epigynum is
small for so large a spider and has a long slender finger in
the middle. These spiders are found singly or in small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
numbers, usually in the woods, sometimes in webs hung
between trees high above the ground.</p>

<p><b>Epeira cinerea.</b>&mdash;This large spider is common in the northern
part of New England, from Maine to New York, where it lives
in great numbers about barns and houses.
It grows to three-quarters of an inch in
length, with the abdomen proportionally
larger than <i>angulata</i> and with two small
humps on the front part <a href="#f391.png">(fig. 391)</a>. The
color is dirty white, with grayish markings
and long white hairs scattered all over the
body. The cephalothorax is a little darkened
at the sides, but has no distinct stripes.
The legs have gray rings at the ends and
middle of each joint, which are hardly visible
in some individuals and almost black in others. The markings
are like those of <i>angulata</i>, but paler and often indistinct. The
sternum is brown, and the under side of the abdomen has a
central dark stripe bordered by curved yellow
markings. The epigynum is small, as in <i>angulata</i>,
but the finger is flattened and turned up
at the end. The male is colored like the
female, with the hairs on the legs coarser
and darker. The tibia of the second legs of
the male is not thickened or modified as it
is in <i>angulata</i>. The webs resemble those
of <i>E. sclopetaria</i>, and the spider has similar
habits, standing in the web at night and
usually leaving it in the daytime; and it has
no special thread from the web to the nest.</p>

<p><b>Epeira corticaria.</b>&mdash;This is a small species about quarter of an
inch in length, with the abdomen angular in front, where it is
as wide as long <a href="#f392.png">(fig. 392)</a>. The colors are generally lighter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
brighter than in <i>angulata</i> or <i>silvatica</i>. The cephalothorax has
the cephalic part brown and the sides pale. The legs are
marked with broken brown rings at the ends and middle of
each joint. The abdomen is brown of various shades, with
light markings on the front part that are often bright red or
yellow. There is a narrow light line across the
abdomen from the middle to each hump and
around the outer side
of it. In front of these
light lines the abdomen
is generally darker, except
a light spot, sometimes
cross shaped, in
the middle. The hinder
half of the abdomen has
sometimes an indistinct
middle stripe. The
under side of the abdomen
has the usual middle
dark area, with a
curved yellow mark each
side of it. The finger
of the epigynum is usually
absent, as if broken
off.</p>

<p><b>Epeira trivittata</b> and
<b>domiciliorum.</b>&mdash;These
spiders, which may be
considered varieties of
one species, are among the most common Epeirid&aelig;, at least in
the northern part of the country, the smaller variety, <i>trivittata</i>,
quarter of an inch long, living in small bushes and marsh grass,
and the larger variety in trees and fences. The abdomen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
only a little longer than wide and is proportionally smaller than
in <i>insularis</i> and <i>thaddeus</i>. The legs are long and slender, the
first pair being nearly twice as long as the body. The color is
most commonly light yellow, with brown markings. Sometimes
the abdomen is thickly spotted with red, especially toward the
latter part of the summer, and <i>domiciliorum</i> has usually gray
and even black markings. The cephalothorax has three dark
stripes not very sharply defined, and the legs have brown or
gray rings at the ends of the joints. The back of the abdomen
has a row of light spots in the middle, sometimes united into
a stripe, and on each side of this a row of dark
spots nearly surrounded by lighter color. The
sternum is bright yellow in the middle, and
the under side of the abdomen has a dark
center and two or three pairs of yellow spots.</p>

<p>The males are usually smaller than the
females, but resemble them in color and markings.
On the under side of each femur is a
single row of long spines. The tibia of the
second legs is curved more in the small than
in the large variety and has a row of strong
spines on the inner side.</p>

<p>The webs are made usually just before dark, and the spider
stands in them more in the night than during the daytime.
Sometimes they make a thread from the center of the web to
the nest, but this is not a regular habit, as it is with <i>insularis</i>
<a href="#f397.jpg">(fig. 397)</a>.</p>

<p>Very young spiders make proportionally larger nests, often on
the ends of grasses, where their round webs are destroyed every
day by the wind. Some of them mature as early as June, and
others, especially of the <i>domiciliorum</i> variety, as late as August.</p>

<p><b>Epeira pratensis.</b>&mdash;This is the same size and color as <i>Epeira
trivittata</i>, and lives, like that species, in grass and low bushes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
The cephalothorax and abdomen are both slightly longer than
in <i>trivittata</i>, and the color is more uniform. The cephalothorax
is dull yellow, with a middle and two lateral stripes, but these
are often absent in
light specimens. The
legs are colored like
the cephalothorax,
sometimes a little
darker at the ends of
the joints. The abdomen
has a middle dark
stripe, at the sides of
which are two narrow
bright yellow lines,
which are sometimes
bordered with red.
Outside of the middle
stripes are six pairs of
black spots partly surrounded
by yellow. On
the under side the sternum
has a yellow stripe
in the middle, and the
abdomen two curved
yellow marks, which
may be broken into
spots. In the male
the body is longer and
narrower than in the female and longer than the male <i>trivittata</i>,
and the tibi&aelig; of the second legs are a little thickened and curved
as in <i>trivittata</i>.</p>

bright yellow or orange color, with brown or purple markings
<a href="#f398-9.png">(fig. 398)</a>. The cephalothorax is dull yellow, with slightly
darker lines in the middle and at the sides. The femur and
patella of all the legs are bright orange, darker toward the ends.
The other joints are white, with brown ends. The light parts
of the abdomen are bright yellow marked with brown. In the
middle is a narrow deeply scalloped stripe, bordered by a wide
yellow line, outside of which are oblique yellow and brown
markings. In the middle of the stripe is a row of light spots,
each connected at the sides with two others, smaller and round,
forming a large figure at the anterior end. On the under side
the sternum is brown and bright yellow in the middle. The
abdomen is dark brown, with two semicircular
yellow spots. The males <a href="#f398-9.png">(fig. 399)</a> are about half as long as the
females. The tibi&aelig; of the second legs
are thickened, and the spines on the
inner side short and stout. The cox&aelig;
of the second legs have a
conical spine near the base.
This spider lives in bushes
three or four feet high. It
makes a tent of leaves <a href="#f397.jpg">(fig. 397)</a>, in which it usually
stands out of sight, holding
a thread which leads to the
center of the nest. Young
spiders make larger tents in
proportion to their size and
make them entirely of silk
<a href="#f400.jpg">(fig. 400)</a>. In Massachusetts and Connecticut it matures about
the first of September. It is found all over the country, and
is probably a variety of the European <i>Epeira marmorea</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Epeira thaddeus.</b>&mdash;A small species resembling the young of
<i>insularis</i>, but with less distinct markings on the back. Full-grown
females are about quarter of an inch in length, with the
abdomen large and round <a href="#f401.png">(fig. 401)</a>. The colors are orange
and light yellow like <i>insularis</i>. The two front pairs of legs
have the femur, patella, and tibia orange, darker toward the
ends. The third and fourth legs have the femur and patella
orange. The other joints are white, with dark rings at the ends.
The tibia of the fourth pair has a wide dark ring at the end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
The abdomen is white or light yellow on the upper side, and
brown underneath, the edge of the dark color coming far
enough up to be seen from
above, around the sides and
front <a href="#f401.png">(fig. 401)</a>. Under the
middle of the abdomen is a
yellow spot just behind the
epigynum <a href="#f401.png">(fig. 401 <i>a</i>)</a>. In some
individuals there is a trace of
markings on the hinder part
of the abdomen, and the
under side is sometimes light, so that there is a dark ring
around the middle of the abdomen. This spider makes a tent
near the web and lives in
it like <i>insularis</i>.</p>

<p><b>Epeira trifolium.</b>&mdash;This is
one of the largest species
of the family, measuring
from half to three-quarters
of an inch long, with a
large round abdomen,
usually of a purplish brown
color, and legs strongly
marked with black rings
<a href="#f403-4.png">(fig. 403)</a>. The cephalothorax
is white, with three
wide black stripes. The
legs are white, with a black
ring at the end of each
joint and in the middle of
the fourth femur. The
back of the abdomen varies
in color from dark purplish brown to light gray or white, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
sometimes light yellow, and the same individual will change
from light color to dark. The usual markings are four white
spots and a middle row of smaller spots, with several
oblique rows still smaller. All trace of the usual
middle stripe is wanting except in very
young individuals. The under side of
the abdomen is dark brown, and the
usual semicircular yellow marks are
absent except in the young. The
males <a href="#f403-4.png">(fig. 404)</a> are not more than half
as long as the females and slender and
light colored. The markings are like
those of the female, but less distinct.
The tibi&aelig; of the second legs are not
thickened or modified in shape as they
are in the male <i>insularis</i>. <i>Trifolium</i>
makes a large web in bushes, but seldom
stands in it. It has near by a
tent above the web <a href="#f402.jpg">(fig. 402)</a> made of
leaves, drawn together and lined with
silk, connected with the center of the
web by a strong thread, and it usually
remains in this tent
with one foot on the
thread, so that it feels
when anything is
caught. The spiders
mature in September,
when the males may sometimes be seen about
the nests of the females. In October they
lay their eggs and all die before winter.</p>

The front half of the abdomen is nearly covered by four white,
yellow, or pink spots, partly united into a rectangular figure
surrounded by an irregular black line <a href="#f407.png">(fig. 407)</a>. The hinder
half has three or four pairs of black spots.
The general color is light brownish yellow.
The cephalothorax has a fine middle line
from the eyes to the dorsal groove and indistinct
dark marks at the sides of the head.
The first and second legs have slightly darker
rings at the end and middle of each joint, the
third and fourth pairs at the ends of the joints
only. The male is marked like the female and
has the tibia of the second legs slightly curved and thickened
with large spines on the inner side.</p>

<p>This spider makes a very large tent, out of which a strong
thread runs to the center of the round web <a href="#f406.jpg">(fig. 406)</a>. From
the tent a loose and irregular web extends downward, sometimes
covering half of the round web <a href="#f406.jpg">(fig. 406)</a>. Opposite the

<p><b>Epeira gibberosa.</b>&mdash;A small and
light-colored species living among

the male smaller. The cephalothorax
and legs are light greenish
yellow, and the abdomen gray, or
light yellow covered with lighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
spots and black and yellow markings <a href="#f411-2.png">(fig. 411)</a>. The abdomen
is marked with two parallel lines on the hinder half and three
smaller black spots in front, the latter often absent. The
parallel lines are sometimes broken up into rows of spots, and
these may form part of several transverse black and yellow
marks. The cephalothorax has a narrow black line in the
middle from the dorsal groove nearly to the eyes. The feet
are black toward the claws, and the spines
of the legs are long and black. The first
and second femora have a longitudinal
black line on the under side. The abdomen
is oval, half longer than wide. The
cephalothorax is high in the middle and
slopes forward toward the eyes almost as
steeply as backward <a href="#f411-2.png">(fig. 412)</a>. The web
<a href="#f413.jpg">(fig. 413)</a> is horizontal or inclined, with a
round well-defined central portion, in the
middle of which is sometimes a round
opaque screen that nearly covers the
spider. In the finished web there is
usually no trace of the temporary spiral,
but sometimes, as in the figure, a little of
it is left, showing how it starts abruptly
from the closer spirals that form the
center of the web. The outer spirals are very fine and close
together and the number of rays unusually large, sometimes as
many as sixty.</p>

<p><b>Epeira placida.</b>&mdash;This is a small spider, about a fifth of an
inch long, with the longest legs about a quarter of an inch.
The cephalothorax is high in the middle where it rests
against the abdomen very much as it is in <i>gibberosa</i> <a href="#f411-2.png">(fig. 412)</a>.
The abdomen is oval, and widest behind. The legs are comparatively
short and tapering, and the femora thick. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
cephalothorax is brownish yellow, with three brown stripes.
The legs are the same color, a little darker at the ends of the
joints. The abdomen has a middle brown stripe, narrow in
front and widening to the middle, from which it extends to the
spinnerets, keeping about the same width, with a row of black
spots on the edge at each side and a pair of white spots in the
middle <a href="#f414.png">(fig. 414)</a>. The sides of the abdomen are white or yellow,
and underneath it is brown, with two white stripes in the middle
and four white spots around the spinnerets. The male is
marked like the female and has no peculiar modifications of
the legs. This spider matures early, sometimes before the
first of June in Massachusetts, and half-grown young are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
found in the autumn. The web is like that of <i>gibberosa</i>, with
a large, round, and close inner spiral from which, in the unfinished
web, the temporary spiral starts abruptly. The web is
made in low bushes and may be vertical or inclined.</p>

<p><b>Epeira scutulata.</b>&mdash;A light yellow spider, a sixth to a fifth of
an inch long, with the abdomen angular behind and at the
sides and as wide as long <a href="#f415.png">(fig. 415)</a>. The cephalothorax
is half as wide in front as it is behind,
and the lateral eyes are as far from the middle
eyes as they are from each other. The front
legs are a fourth longer than the second. The
general color is light yellow, the legs darker at
the ends of the joints, with long black spines.
The head has a few brown or red marks behind
the eyes and back to the dorsal groove, but these
are often entirely absent. The
abdomen is lighter across the front between
the two corners, and there is sometimes a
distinct white transverse stripe. In front of
each corner is a black spot, and there is
generally a row of small black spots around
the front of the abdomen, and two rows behind
converging toward the spinnerets. In the
hinder rows of spots the middle pair are
generally longest, and sometimes these are
the only pair present. The under side has no
distinct markings. The epigynum is dark at
the sides, and the finger is short and flat at the
end and turned a little outward. The male
has the legs longer, and the cephalothorax wider behind. The
abdomen is not much larger than the cephalothorax and less
angular than in the female. The colors are the same as in the
female, some individuals being light and some dark.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Epeira parvula.</b>&mdash;A common spider all over the country, with
the abdomen wide in front and bluntly pointed behind, gray
and brown colors and a great variety of markings. The length
is quarter to three-eighths of an
inch, with the abdomen two-thirds
as long and as wide across the
front. The abdomen is as high
behind as it is in front, and the
pointed end is sometimes turned a
little upward, as it is in <i>conica</i>. The
front of the head is narrow, not more than half as wide as the
back of the thorax. The front legs are half longer than the
body. The cephalothorax is gray, darker at the sides, and
sometimes with a few black spots. The legs are irregularly
marked with rings and spots, and the femora are dark toward
the end. The abdomen is commonly gray, with a tapering
scalloped middle stripe and a distinct dark middle spot and
two large light spots at the front end <a href="#f416-8.png">(fig. 416)</a>. Sometimes
there is a middle narrow dark stripe
the whole length of the abdomen <a href="#f416-8.png">(fig. 418)</a>, and sometimes all the middle is
white or light yellow. The males have
the head a little narrower and more
pointed, the legs longer, and the second
tibia slightly thickened, but not curved.
The webs are in low bushes.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Epeira stellata.</b>&mdash;A brown spider, a
quarter to a third of an inch long and
nearly as broad, with pointed humps
around the abdomen. The cephalothorax
is wide in front, and the lateral eyes are on the outer sharp
corners. The legs are short and usually drawn up and partly
concealed under the abdomen. The abdomen has a sharp point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
in front that extends over the cephalothorax as far as the base
of the first legs, and a large point behind, with a smaller one
under it. At the sides are five pairs of points, and over the
first of these another pair a little higher on the back. The
cephalothorax is brown, lighter in the middle and darker at
the sides, and covered with short gray hairs. The abdomen is
marked with lighter and darker spots of brown, the front part
generally dark with a very light middle spot, and the hinder
half showing traces of the usual middle stripe of Epeira. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
legs have dark rings at the ends and middle of the joints. It
lives among low bushes a foot or two from the ground all over
the country. This spider, as well as several other species,
often leaves a web unfinished with the inner spiral still covering
a large part of it, as in <a href="#f420.jpg">fig. 420</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Epeira verrucosa.</b>&mdash;Common in the South and as far north as
Long Island, N.Y. The body is about a quarter of an inch
long. The abdomen is narrow behind but not pointed, and in
front nearly as wide as long. The middle is nearly covered by
a triangular light spot,&mdash;white, yellow, or pink in
different spiders,&mdash;surrounded by a darker color
of various shades of brown or gray. The cephalothorax
is yellow or light gray, with sometimes
some darker spots in the middle. The legs
are colored like the thorax,
with darker rings at the
ends of the joints and in
the middle of the first
and second femora.
The spines are slender
and colored like the
hairs. The abdomen
has a prominent tubercle
behind, at the end
of the light spot, and
under it in the middle
line two others. At
the sides near the posterior
end are two pairs
of tubercles, and sometimes
two other pairs farther forward, and two at the corners of
the light spot. The colors of the under side are as variable
as those above,&mdash;sometimes light without distinct markings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and sometimes almost black at the sides, on the sternum, and
around the spinnerets. The epigynum <a href="#f421-3.png">(fig. 422)</a> has a slender
pointed finger reaching halfway to the spinnerets.</p>

<p>The male <a href="#f421-3.png">(fig. 423)</a> has the head narrower than the female,
and the abdomen as small as the cephalothorax. The legs are
longer and more slender, with the metatarsus of the second
pair curved inward, and a long forked spine on
the inside of the tibia of the same legs.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Larinia directa.</b>&mdash;This resembles a much
elongated <i>Epeira pratensis</i> (p. <a href="#Page_167">167</a>). It
is about as long as <i>pratensis</i>, a quarter
to a third of an inch, but very slender,&mdash;not
much more than a quarter as
wide as long <a href="#f424-7.png">(fig. 425)</a>. The general
color is yellowish but pale and
translucent, marked with very distinct
black spots. The spots are
usually in six pairs on the abdomen,
sometimes so small as to be hardly
visible, sometimes so large as to be
the most distinct part of the spider.
In some individuals there is a row
of black spots on the upper side of
each leg, so that when these are
drawn up over the back hardly anything
is visible except the spots. In
some individuals the first and third
pairs of spots on the abdomen are very large and the others
very small <a href="#f424-7.png">(fig. 426)</a>. The sternum is nearly twice as long as
wide, with the sides of the front half parallel. It is darker at
the sides. On the under side of the abdomen are two parallel
dark stripes. In the male <a href="#f424-7.png">(fig. 424)</a> the front legs are nearly
three times the length of the body, but neither the first nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the second pair is curved or thickened. It is found in South
Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.</p>

<p><b>Cyclosa conica</b> or <b>caudata.</b>&mdash;This spider may be known by the
blunt conical hump at the hinder end of the abdomen, extending
upward and backward over the spinnerets (figs. <a href="#f428-9.png">428, 429</a>).
Full-grown females are about quarter of an inch long. The
color is a mixture of gray and white, different individuals varying
from almost white to almost black. The cephalothorax
is longer than wide, the front part narrow, and the top of the
front of the head extended forward beyond
the base of the mandibles. The hump on
the abdomen varies considerably in size,
and is generally about half as long as the
rest of the abdomen and slopes gradually
into it. In light individuals the markings
of the abdomen are obscure, but usually
there is a distinct dark middle stripe,
widest near the base of the hump. The
under side is black, with a pair of very distinct light spots
across the middle. The cephalothorax is dark gray or black
without stripes, sometimes a little lighter around the eyes.
The legs are white, with dark rings at the end of each joint
and in the middle of each except the femora. On the first
and second femora the dark rings are very wide, covering
sometimes more than half the joint. The males have the
cephalothorax darker and narrower in front, and the abdomen
smaller, with only a slight hump. The spider seems to live all
the time in the web. The inner spiral is large and widens
gradually from the center outward. There is usually a line of
silk across the web, in which are fastened parts of dead insects
and other rubbish and, in the middle of the summer, the cocoons
of eggs. The spider, standing in the middle of this band where
it crosses the center of the web, looks like part of the rubbish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
When an old web is torn down this band of rubbish is left in
place, and the new web made across it. A peculiarity of the
web of this spider is that the inner spiral has one, and sometimes
two, loops in it, making it wider than it is high <a href="#f430.jpg">(fig. 430)</a>.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 432.</span> Middle of web of Zilla atrica with

</div>

<p>We have three species of Zilla, the females of which are so
much alike that it is almost impossible to tell them apart.
The males also resemble each other closely except in their
palpi, which are distinctly different in the different species.
They are of moderate size, the largest about three-eighths of
an inch long, and in general appearance resemble the genus
Steatoda of the Theridid&aelig; (p. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>). The abdomen is large
and oval and a little flattened. The legs are slender and of
moderate length, like those of Epeira. The head is rounded in
front, and the lateral eyes are not separated farther from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
middle pairs than they are from each other. The mandibles
are large and thickened in the middle toward the front. The
epigynum and the spinnerets are both small. The color
of all the species is gray, with sometimes a little yellow
or pink in the lighter parts. The cephalothorax has
usually, but not always, a dark border at the
sides and a middle dark line that widens and
becomes lighter toward the eyes. The abdomen
has a wide middle stripe like Epeira, scalloped at
the sides and crossed at the hinder end by two
or three pairs of transverse spots. In front it is
almost white or tinted with pink or yellow, and
narrows almost to a point, with a much darker
spot each side. The sides of the abdomen are
marked with oblique dark marks that extend
underneath. The sternum has a light middle stripe. Under
the abdomen is a dark middle stripe, with light each side of it.
The legs are pale, with narrow
gray rings at the end
and middle of each joint.
These three species seem to
be the same as three found
in Europe,&mdash;<i>Z. atrica</i>, <i>Z.
x-notata</i>, and <i>Z. montana</i>.
<i>Atrica</i> is found at Ipswich
and Salem on the coast of
Massachusetts, <i>x-notata</i> at
Woods Hole on the south
coast of Massachusetts, and
<i>montana</i> in the White Mountains
and Adirondacks.
Wherever found they are in large numbers, <i>atrica</i> and <i>x-notata</i>
living on the outside of houses, and <i>montana</i> in trees and rocks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
The webs of Zilla <a href="#f432.jpg">(fig. 432)</a> have a segment left without cross
threads, sometimes for its whole length, and sometimes only
the part of it nearest the center. Opposite this open segment
a thread leads from the center of the web to the nest <a href="#f433.jpg">(fig. 433)</a>,
which is a tube of silk open at both
ends.</p>

<p>The differences between the palpi
of the males are very plain. In <i>atrica</i>
the palpi <a href="#f434-5.png">(fig. 434)</a> are as long as the
whole body, with the femur and tibia
both slightly curved and the tarsus
and palpal organ small and like that
of <i>x-notata</i>. In <i>x-notata</i> <a href="#f434-5.png">(fig. 435)</a> the
palpus is as long as the cephalothorax,
and the tarsus and palpal organ small
and round. The front legs are a
fourth longer than in <i>atrica</i>. In
<i>montana</i> <a href="#f434-5.png">(fig. 435<i>a</i>)</a> the palpus is still
shorter, the tibia thicker, and the tarsus
and palpal organ larger. There
is little difference in the shape of the
epigynum of the different species, but
that of <i>montana</i> is twice as large as
that of <i>x-notata</i> or <i>atrica</i>.</p>

<p><b>Singa pratensis.</b>&mdash;The Singas are
small Epeirid&aelig; a sixth or fifth of an
inch long, with smooth bodies and
bright colors. They live among grass and other small plants in
low open ground. When full grown the females of <i>S. pratensis</i>
are a fifth of an inch long, with the abdomen oval and marked
with a double white stripe in the middle and a single one on
each side. The cephalothorax is yellow, with a little black
between the middle eyes not extending to the lateral pairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
The legs are yellow, without rings or other markings. The
abdomen is yellow brown, darker toward the hinder end, with
white or light yellow stripes. The under side is the same
yellow-brown color, darker in the middle, with two narrow,
curved, light lines from
the spiracles to the spinnerets.
The males are
marked in the same way
and have a smaller abdomen
and longer spines
on the legs.</p>

<p><b>Singa variabilis.</b>&mdash;This
is a little smaller than
<i>pratensis</i>, usually about a
sixth of an inch long.
The legs and cephalothorax
are bright orange
color. The front of the
head between the eyes is black. The abdomen is usually
entirely black, but occasionally has bright yellow markings
<a href="#f436.png">(fig. 436)</a> arranged somewhat as in <i>pratensis</i>. Sometimes there
is a wide middle stripe, with narrower
ones at the sides and two underneath.
Sometimes there are only the two lateral
stripes, and there are all variations
between these markings. The males
are colored in the same way and have
the same varieties. They are smaller than the males of
<i>pratensis</i>, but have the palpal organs as large or larger.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>These are small spiders, with the abdomen extended back
half its length beyond the spinnerets, brightly colored, flattened
above, and furnished with several pairs of pointed
processes. The cephalothorax is longer than in Epeira and
Argiope and widest in the middle. The legs are slender
and have only fine and soft hairs. The webs <a href="#f437.jpg">(fig. 437)</a> are
inclined and have a hole in the middle surrounded by several
turns of smooth thread; when hanging in it the spiders look
like burrs or seeds. At a slight alarm they will sometimes
drop to the ground and hide under the nearest shelter.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 439.</span> Acrosoma
rugosa, enlarged

</div>

<p><b>Acrosoma mitrata.</b>&mdash;This is a smaller species than <i>rugosa</i> or
<i>spinea</i>. The abdomen does not extend as far backward as in
the other species, but comes farther forward so as to cover
half the cephalothorax <a href="#f438.png">(fig. 438)</a>. The abdomen
is truncated behind, with two pairs of pointed
processes at the corners, one pair below the other.
In front, the abdomen is a little narrowed over
the thorax. The legs and cephalothorax are
brown, as in the other species. The abdomen
is light yellow, darker behind, with two or three
pairs of black spots along the middle and five
or six dark elongated spots along the sides.
The under side is black mixed with yellow spots, as in the
other species. Common as far north as Connecticut.</p>

<p><b>Acrosoma rugosa.</b>&mdash;This has five pairs of spines on the abdomen,
three pairs in the same places as those of <i>spinea</i> and the
other two pairs behind and under the last of the three. All
the humps and spines are about the same size.
The cephalothorax and legs resemble those of
<i>spinea</i>, but the legs are shorter. The colors are
white, yellow, and brown in spots and marks
like those of <i>spinea</i>, some individuals being
almost white, and others as nearly black. The
males have a long slender abdomen without
humps or spines. This is a common spider as
far north as Connecticut, where it is occasionally
found.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Acrosoma spinea.</b>&mdash;This spider is distinguished
from all the common species by the shape of
its abdomen, which is narrow in front and has
two long spreading points behind <a href="#f440-2.png">(fig. 440)</a>. There is a pair of
smaller spines on the front of the abdomen and another near
the middle of each side. The middle of the abdomen is white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
or bright yellow. The spines are black at the points and bright
red at the base. There are several black spots on the back, and
gray marks at the sides. The under side of
the abdomen is darker than it is above and
marked with black and yellow spots. The
cephalothorax and legs are light
brown, the thorax with lighter edges.
The young have the abdomen
longer, with the posterior spines
short and blunt.
The third and
fourth legs are
whitish, with dark
longitudinal
stripes. The males
are smaller than
the females and resemble
the young.
The abdomen is a little widened behind and has
in place of the spines three pairs of low bumps.
The front legs are dark, and the hinder legs light,
as in the young. The web <a href="#f437.jpg">(fig. 437)</a> has a hole
in the middle, across which the spider hangs.</p>

<p><b>Meta menardi.</b>&mdash;This spider lives in caves and
similar cool and shady places in various parts of
this country and also in Europe. In general
appearance, especially when young, it reminds
one of Linyphia. The abdomen is
longer than wide, high in front, and
tapering a little behind <a href="#f443-5.png">(fig. 445)</a>.
The eyes are near together, the
lateral eyes almost as near the middle pairs as they are to each
other. The mandibles are long, thickened in front near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
base, and slightly turned outward at the ends and strongly
toothed on the inner side about the claw. The maxill&aelig; are
also long and a little widened at the ends. The dorsal groove
is very deep. The legs are long, the front pair twice the length
of the body. The full-grown
female is half an inch in
length, the male a third
shorter, but with legs nearly
as long. The general color
is gray, the lighter parts
translucent and yellowish.
The cephalothorax has three
gray stripes, more distinct in
the young, a middle stripe
from the eyes to the dorsal
groove, and one on each side
of the thorax. In the young
<a href="#f443-5.png">(fig. 444)</a> the markings of the
abdomen are two large dark
spots near the front end and
several other pairs, becoming
smaller toward the hinder
end. In adults these markings
unite into a middle
stripe more like Epeira, with
a light middle spot in front
and several middle spots and
pairs of spots diminishing
backward. The legs have gray rings at the ends and middle
of the joints. The webs are horizontal or inclined, according
to the shape of the rocks on which they are built. They
resemble the webs of Tetragnatha, having a small central spiral
with a round hole in the middle, across which the spider holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
herself. This spider matures late in the autumn or early in
the summer, and makes large, loose, and transparent cocoons,
hung near the webs.</p>

</div>



<p><b>Argyroepeira hortorum.</b>&mdash;This is a green and silver-white
spider, with slender legs and a long abdomen resembling
Tetragnatha. The
body of the female is
about a quarter of an
inch long, the abdomen
twice as long as
wide, and blunt at both
ends <a href="#f446-7.png">(fig. 447)</a>. The
first pair of legs are
twice as long as the
body, the second a
fourth shorter <a href="#f446-7.png">(fig. 446)</a>. The legs are
bright green, darker
toward the ends. The
cephalothorax is green,
with a darker stripe in
the middle and one on
each side. The upper
part of the abdomen
is silver white, with a
dark line through the
middle, giving off four
pairs of branches at the
sides. At the sides of
the abdomen are yellow
stripes extending
downward, and toward the hinder end two bright copper-red
spots. The colors of the under side are as bright as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
above and are more plainly seen as the spider hangs in its
web. The basal joints of the legs are light in color, and the
sternum and mouth parts dark. The abdomen is green,
darker from front to back, where it is almost black
around the spinnerets. In the middle
is a large double spot of bright copper
red, and the red spots at the end of the
body show as plainly from below as
from above, and around the middle
spot are several small spots of bright
yellow. The hairs and spines of the
legs are so fine that they do not much
affect the general color. On the front
side of the femur of the
fourth leg there is a fringe
of long hairs extending half
its length. The males are
half as large as the females,
with longer and more slender
legs and palpi, and the
same colors. The webs are
nearly horizontal, with a
small hole in the center,
and under the round web
is often a large irregular
web. The round web may
be a foot in diameter, or it may be so
small as hardly to cover the spider. The
webs have a large number of rays, and
the spirals are very close together, as in the webs of <i>Epeira
gibberosa</i> <a href="#f413.jpg">(fig. 413)</a>. The smooth central part of the web
is circular and very regularly woven, showing usually no
trace of the beginning of the temporary spirals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
between it and the sticky circles there is a wide space in which
is nothing but the bare rays.</p>

<p><b>Argiope riparia.</b>&mdash;This and the next species are among the
largest and most conspicuous of the round-web spiders. It
lives among grass and low bushes in open fields and meadows,
especially along the borders of ponds and ditches. It matures
in the northern states about the first of August. Large females
are nearly an inch long, with the front legs longer than the body
<a href="#f449-0.png">(fig. 449)</a>. The cephalothorax is nearly as wide as long and
covered with silvery white hairs, except around the eyes. The
front legs are entirely black, and the others are black, except
the femora, which are light red or yellow. The abdomen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
oval, a little pointed behind and square in front, with two small
humps at the corners. There is a black stripe in the middle
of the abdomen, narrowed between the humps and widened in
the middle, where it includes two pairs of yellow spots. Along
the sides are two bright yellow bands or rows of irregular spots.
The color underneath is black, with a yellow stripe on the
sternum and two wide yellow stripes on the abdomen, with
small yellow spots between and at the sides. The young
differ considerably from the adults. Until nearly full grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the legs are distinctly marked with dark rings on the ends
and middle of each joint. When very young the abdomen is
slender, the color is pale, and the markings gray, without the
strong black and yellow of the adult. The male <a href="#f449-0.png">(fig. 450)</a> is
only a fourth as long as the female, similarly colored, but with
the markings less distinct and the palpi very large. In the middle
of the summer they live near the webs of the females, where
they make small and imperfect webs of their own <a href="#f452.jpg">(fig. 452)</a>.
The females make webs, sometimes two feet in diameter, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
a zigzag band <a href="#f448.jpg">(fig. 448)</a> of white silk up and down across the
middle, and a round thick spot where the spider stands. The
inner spiral of these webs is very large, covering a quarter of
their diameter <a href="#f452.jpg">(fig. 452)</a>. The outer spiral comes very near
it, but the spider sometimes passes
through the narrow space between
them from one side of the web to
the other. The web is usually a
little inclined, and on one or both
sides sometimes has a screen of
irregular threads two or three inches
distant from it <a href="#f453.jpg">(fig. 453)</a>, but these
are often absent. These spiders
have no nest and stand all the time
in the center of the web <a href="#f448.jpg">(fig. 448)</a>.
Sometimes the spider draws away
the grass and leaves so as to make
an oval opening large enough for
the web <a href="#f453.jpg">(fig. 453)</a>. In September
the eggs are laid in large pear-shaped
cocoons with a brown paper-like
surface, hung by threads among
the grass and bushes <a href="#f454.jpg">(fig. 454)</a>. The
young hatch during the winter and
remain in the cocoon until May. The
adult spiders disappear in October
and probably all die before winter.</p>

<p><b>Argiope transversa.</b>&mdash;This species
is a little smaller than <i>riparia</i>. It lives in the same places and
matures a little later, about September 1. The abdomen is more
pointed than that of <i>riparia</i> <a href="#f455-6.png">(fig. 455)</a>. The ground color is
white or light yellow, and is crossed by a great number of black
transverse lines, which are sometimes obscured, especially in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
young spiders, by a thick covering of silvery-white hairs. The
cephalothorax is covered with white hairs through which the
dark markings on the sides show indistinctly. The legs are
light yellow, with black bands at the ends and middle of each
joint. The femora of the first legs are sometimes entirely
black. The young have the back entirely
white. The markings of the under side
are similar to those of <i>riparia</i>. The male
<a href="#f455-6.png">(fig. 456)</a> is colored like the female, but is
only a fourth as large. The legs are yellow,
marked with black spots, but have no
rings. It has the same habits as <i>riparia</i>.
It remains in its web later in the season,
and makes a cocoon flattened on the top
<a href="#f458.jpg">(fig. 458)</a> instead of narrowed to a neck,
like those of <i>riparia</i>.</p>

<p>This species often makes its web in
marsh grass, which it draws away and
fastens with silk <a href="#f457.jpg">(fig. 457)</a>. As the surrounding
grass becomes long and weak,
it sometimes falls away, leaving the web
in a basket of grass fastened firmly
enough together to remain standing.</p>


<h3>THE GENUS TETRAGNATHA</h3>



<div class="figright" style="width: 317px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 459.</span> Web of Tetragnatha in tansy plants, showing the spider in its usual position.</span>
</div>

<p>The Tetragnathas are slender, usually
straw-colored spiders, living in their webs
among the long grass in meadows and near water. The legs
are slender, the cephalothorax narrow, and the abdomen long and
cylindrical. The mandibles are large in both sexes, and in the
males are very long and furnished with long teeth at the end
and along the inner margin. When pairing, the male and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
female hold each other by the ends of the mandibles. The eyes
are in two rows nearly equal and parallel, and the distance
between the lateral pairs varies in different species. The palpi
are long and slender in both sexes, and in the males their
proportions differ according to the species. The legs are also
long and slender, and vary in length from <i>grallator</i>, where the
female has the first legs ten times as long as the cephalothorax,
to <i>laboriosa</i>, in which they are seven times as long. The webs
are generally inclined and may be nearly horizontal or nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
vertical, according to the place where they are made <a href="#f459.jpg">(fig. 459)</a>.
The inner spiral is small and has a hole in the middle <a href="#f460.jpg">(fig. 460)</a>.
The spider stands in the web with the legs extended forward
and backward close to each
other, except at the ends,
where they are turned outward
<a href="#f459.jpg">(fig. 459)</a>. On account
of their similar size and color,
the species look at first sight
much alike, but there are differences
in the arrangement
of the lateral eyes and the
length of the legs, palpi, and
mandibles.</p>

<p><b>Tetragnatha grallator.</b>&mdash;This
spider grows to be half an
inch long, with the first legs
an inch and a half. The
mandibles of the female are
as long as the cephalothorax,
and those of the male longer
(figs. <a href="#f461-4.png">461</a>, <a href="#f465-6.png">465</a>). In both sexes
they are inclined forward, so
as to be nearly horizontal and
spread apart at the ends. The
lateral eyes are near together,
so that they almost touch, and
the upper row when seen from above is nearly straight. The
palpi of both sexes are over one and a half times as long as
the cephalothorax, and in the males sometimes twice as long
<a href="#f465-6.png">(fig. 465)</a>. The patella and tibia together are nearly as long
as the femur. The color is sometimes light yellow, but
often gray, with a broken middle stripe of darker gray on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
abdomen, and three stripes on the cephalothorax. The abdomen
is generally enlarged a little in the front third <a href="#f461-4.png">(fig. 461)</a>.
The males are smaller and more slender than the females, with
longer legs and mandibles.</p>

<p><b>Tetragnatha extensa.</b>&mdash;Female a quarter to three-eighths of
an inch long, with the first leg three-quarters of an inch. The
abdomen is shorter than in <i>grallator</i>, about twice as long as
the cephalothorax, and not as much widened in front <a href="#f461-4.png">(fig. 462)</a>.
The mandibles are two-thirds as long as the cephalothorax and
not much inclined forward. The lateral eyes are near together.
The colors are often dark, dull yellow brown or gray, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
three lines on the cephalothorax and a middle dark stripe
on the abdomen, with a light silvery stripe on each side.</p>

<p>The male is smaller and more slender, with the legs longer.
The male palpi are one-half longer than the cephalothorax, the
femur forming nearly half its length <a href="#f465-6.png">(fig. 466)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Tetragnatha laboriosa.</b>&mdash;A little smaller than <i>extensa</i>, with
shorter legs and mandibles, the latter short enough in the
female to be almost vertical <a href="#f461-4.png">(fig. 463)</a>. The abdomen is proportionally
longer than in <i>extensa</i>, usually in the females three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a><br /><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
times as long as the cephalothorax. The first legs are about
seven times as long as the cephalothorax. The upper row of
eyes is a little curved, so that the lateral pairs of eyes are as far
apart as the middle ones <a href="#f467-8.png">(fig. 467)</a>. The general color is light
yellow. The abdomen is silvery white, with some indistinct
gray markings along the
middle, and dark stripes on
the under side. In the males
the mandibles <a href="#f467-8.png">(fig. 467)</a> are
short compared with the
other species, and are about
two-thirds as long as the
cephalothorax, and the tibia
is very little longer than the

<h2>THE CINIFLONID&AElig;, OR CRIBELLATA</h2>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 469, 470.</span>&mdash;469, cribellum. 470, calamistrum
of Amaurobius sylvestris.</span>
</div>

<p>This group comprises several families that differ
greatly in form and habits, but agree in having
peculiar spinning organs, different from those of all
the other spiders. They have the usual six spinnerets
and in addition the cribellum <a href="#f469-0.png">(fig. 469)</a>, a flat, wide
spinning organ, close in front of the other spinnerets
and covered with
finer spinning
tubes. Besides this
additional spinning
organ they have on
the hind legs the
calamistrum <a href="#f469-0.png">(fig. 470)</a>, a row of hairs that is used to
draw out a loose band of silk from the spinnerets.
Most of our species belong to the genera Dictyna and
Amaurobius and resemble Tegenaria (pp. <a href="#Page_96">96-99</a>) in
their feet with three claws, in the arrangement of the
eyes, and in their general form and color. The others
belong to the small and peculiar genera Filistata,
Hyptiotes, and Uloborus.</p>



<h3>THE GENUS DICTYNA</h3>

<p>The Dictynas are all small spiders, not more
than a sixth of an inch in length, but are
brightly colored and live in webs in open places,
where they cannot fail to be seen by any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
who looks for spiders. They are not easily frightened, and so
their habits can be more easily watched than those of many
larger kinds. The heads are high, arching up from the eyes to
the highest part opposite the first legs <a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 476)</a>. The eyes are
higher and the front of the head is more nearly vertical than in
Amaurobius <a href="#f489-0.png">(fig. 489)</a>. The head is about half as wide as the
thorax and distinctly marked off from it and usually lighter
colored. The abdomen is sometimes marked with light yellow
on a gray ground, as in Amaurobius, or with a light middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
stripe of various shapes, bordered with brown or gray <a href="#f487.png">(fig. 487)</a>.
The whole body is covered with fine hairs, and there are often
long white hairs in rows on the cephalothorax. The cribellum
is large for the size of the spiders and can generally be plainly
seen just in front of the other spinnerets. The calamistrum
is not so easy to see, but it covers about half the length of
the fourth metatarsus. The peculiarities of the species of these
spiders are more strongly marked in the males. The mandibles
of both sexes are long and a little curved forward at the ends
<a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 476)</a>, but in the males they are sometimes so long that the
distance from the ends of the mandibles to the top of the head is
as great as the length of the cephalothorax, and the lower ends
are turned forward at a sharp angle with the upper part. The
mandibles of the males are curved apart in the middle, and they
have at the base a short tooth projecting forward <a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 477)</a>.
The palpi of the males have a process on the tibia, usually
near the base, on the end of which are two spines <a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 478)</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
There is not much difference in size between the sexes, but they
are often very differently colored, and the males do not have
the cribellum and calamistrum, or have only rudiments of them.</p>

<p>Some species live on walls and fences, making large webs
that become conspicuous from
the dust which they collect.
Others prefer the tops of plants
like stiff grass and the tops of
golden-rod and spir&aelig;a. Others,
like <i>volupis</i> <a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 474)</a>, prefer
leaves and the ends of growing
branches. The webs are usually
irregular, but sometimes are
nearly round and formed by
threads radiating from the
spider's hole, crossed irregularly
by other threads <a href="#f471.jpg">(fig. 471)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Dictyna volupis.</b>&mdash;This species
and <i>frondea</i> are brighter
colored and more slender
than <i>muraria</i> and <i>volucripes</i>
<a href="#f484-6.png">(fig. 484)</a> and live among the
leaves of bushes. The female
<i>volupis</i> has the legs pale,
almost white, and the cephalothorax
light brown, darker at
the sides and light on the head
<a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 474)</a>. The abdomen is
yellow in the middle and brown, sometimes red, at the sides.
The middle yellow portion forms a regular figure differing
much in different individuals. The male is quite differently
colored. The cephalothorax, which is larger, is bright orange
brown, without much difference between the head and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
sides <a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 475)</a>. The legs are light orange, darker than those
of the female. The abdomen is dark reddish brown, sometimes
over the whole back, but usually with a yellow irregular
middle spot smaller than that of the female. The ends of the
male palpi are dark colored and as large as the spider's head
<a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 475)</a>. The hairs are very fine and light colored and do
not modify the color as much as they do in the brown species.
The length of <i>volupis</i> is not over an
eighth of an inch. The abdomen is oval
and not as
wide or high
as in <i>volucripes</i>
and <i>muraria</i>.
The head
of the male is
high, and the
mandibles almost
as long
as the cephalothorax
<a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 476)</a>. The lower
half is turned sharply forward
and flattened out at the end.
The mandibles are light orange
brown, so that their shape is
more readily seen than in the
dark species. The tooth on
the front of the base of the
mandibles is very large in this species <a href="#f474-8.png">(fig. 477)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Dictyna frondea.</b>&mdash;This resembles <i>volupis</i> and is likely to be
mistaken for it. It is a little smaller, not over a tenth of an
inch long, and there is less difference between the sexes. The
legs are pale, and the cephalothorax light brown, lighter on the
head. The abdomen is gray at the sides, not as red as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
<i>volupis</i>, and the middle light stripe is narrower and not as
bright yellow <a href="#f479-1.png">(fig. 479)</a>. The sternum and under side of the
abdomen are gray, as dark as the upper
part and sides, while in <i>volupis</i> they are
generally lighter. The males have the
cephalothorax larger, and that and the legs
a little brighter colored than in the female,
and the abdomen darker. The mandibles
are not as long as in the male <i>volupis</i>, and
the ends of the male palpi are much
smaller and the tibia longer and straighter
than in <i>volupis</i> <a href="#f479-1.png">(fig. 481)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Dictyna cruciata.</b>&mdash;About a tenth of an
inch long, with the abdomen large and
oval, as in <i>muraria</i>. The cephalothorax
is light brown above and below, and the
legs the same color, but still lighter. The
abdomen is gray beneath and at the sides,
and silvery white on the back, sometimes
over the whole upper surface, but oftener
in a stripe widened in
the middle so as to
form a white cross on
a gray ground <a href="#f482-3.png">(fig. 482)</a>.
The males are darker
colored, with the light spot on the abdomen
smaller. The male palpi are short and
slender, the ends large and rounded and
carried close to the head <a href="#f482-3.png">(fig. 483)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Dictyna volucripes and muraria.</b>&mdash;These two
gray spiders are the common Dictynas on
walls and fences and on the ends of grass and weeds, where
they make webs shaped according to the places where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
live, having in some part of the web a hole in which the spider
usually hides <a href="#f473.jpg">(fig. 473)</a>. Some allied species make nearly circular
webs on walls, with the hole
near the center, and gather so much
dust as to appear like a spot of dirt
<a href="#f471.jpg">(fig. 471)</a>. <i>Volucripes</i> is about a
sixth of an inch in length, and
<i>muraria</i> an eighth of an inch.
<i>Volucripes</i> is browner in color and more common
on plants, and <i>muraria</i> is grayer and more common
on fences. Both species are marked much
alike. The cephalothorax is dark brown, partly
covered with light gray hairs, some of which
form roughly three stripes on the head. The
abdomen is large and round, in some
females nearly as wide as long. The front
half has a middle dark spot of various
shapes, and the hinder half two rows of
spots connected in
pairs with a middle
line, forming a figure much like the markings of several
species of Epeira (figs. <a href="#f484-6.png">484</a>, <a href="#f487.png">487</a>). The legs are dark gray or
brown, covered with fine hairs, the first pair not much longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
than the body. In the females the mandibles are a little thickened
in the middle. In the male they are elongated and turned
forward at the ends and curved apart in the middle, and have a
small tooth on the front near the base. The palpi of the males
(figs. <a href="#f484-6.png">485, 486</a>) are short, with the patella as wide as it is long
and wider than the femur and tibia. The tarsus is half longer
than wide and pointed at the end. In the tibia there is a little
difference between the species that can be seen by looking at
the palpi from the side; in <i>volucripes</i> there is a stout process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
at the base as long as the tibia itself and pointing upward at a
right angle with it <a href="#f484-6.png">(fig. 485)</a>; in <i>muraria</i> the corresponding process
is short and turned forward, and the tibia seems proportionally
longer <a href="#f484-6.png">(fig. 486)</a>. The cribellum in both these species
is large and can easily
be seen in front of the
other spinnerets. The
calamistrum extends
over half the length of
the fourth metatarsus,
which in <i>volucripes</i> is
slightly curved.</p>

<p><b>Amaurobius sylvestris.</b>&mdash;This
is the common
Amaurobius all over
the northern part of
the country. It resembles
our species of Tegenaria (figs. <a href="#f228-9.png">228</a>,
<a href="#f233-4.png">233</a>) and may easily be mistaken
for them. It does not have long
upper spinnerets like Tegenaria, and
the eyes are lower on the front of the
head. The females <a href="#f489-0.png">(fig. 489)</a> are
two-fifths of an inch long, and the
males a third of an inch, but with
much longer legs. The head of the
female is almost as wide as the middle
of the thorax, and the eyes cover
half its width. The front row of eyes
are within their diameter of the front of the head. The head
is low in front and higher halfway between the eyes and the
dorsal groove. The mandibles are much swelled at the base in
front, as they are in <i>Tegenaria medicinalis</i>. The abdomen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
oval, widest behind, and usually as long as the cephalothorax
or longer. The legs are not more than a fourth longer than
the body, and slender for so large a spider. The cephalothorax
is dark brown, darkest in front, and the legs are a little
lighter brown, without markings. The abdomen is gray, with
a double row of oblique yellow or
white markings on the hinder half
and two curved marks of the same
color on the front. These spots
sometimes run together, so that the
whole middle of the abdomen is
light colored. The males have the
head narrower and the thorax wider
and all the legs longer than the
female, and the cephalothorax and
mandibles are not so dark colored. The male palpi have the
patella as short as wide, and the tibia very short and wide, with
a short hook on the outer and a longer and more slender one
on the inner side, as shown in <a href="#f489-0.png">fig. 490</a>. The epigynum has
a small middle lobe inclosed by two
lateral lobes that meet behind, and by
this the female can be distinguished
from the next species,&mdash;<i>Amaurobius
ferox</i>. The cribellum <a href="#f469-0.png">(fig. 469)</a> is sometimes
covered by a fold of the skin, so
that it is not readily seen. The calamistrum
<a href="#f469-0.png">(fig. 470)</a> is a close row of
curved hairs on the upper side of the
fourth metatarsus, about half its length. In the male the
cribellum is rudimentary, and there is no calamistrum.</p>

<p>This spider makes a large loose web under stones and sticks
<a href="#f488.jpg">(fig. 488)</a>. In the parts freshly made the loose bands of silk can
be seen running irregularly about on the other threads <a href="#f491.png">(fig. 491)</a>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Amaurobius ferox.</b>&mdash;This lives in houses and is probably an
imported species, as it is more common in Europe. It grows
a little larger than <i>sylvestris</i> <a href="#f489-0.png">(fig. 489)</a>, and
the head is a little more narrowed in front
of the legs. The colors and markings are
much as in <i>sylvestris</i>, but the abdomen is
often darker, and the middle light stripe on
the front more distinct. The epigynum
has a larger middle lobe, and the lateral
lobes are straighter and do not meet in the
middle. The males are colored like the
females and have the thorax wider and
the legs longer. The palpi of the male
have the tarsus short and round. The tibia
<a href="#f492.png">(fig. 492)</a> has only a small short hook on the
inner side, and a large blunt process on the
outer side. The male palpi and the epigynum
distinguish these easily from the last species.</p>

<p><b>Amaurobius (Titan&oelig;ca) americana.</b>&mdash;Quarter
of an inch long and deep black, except the cephalothorax,
which is dull orange color, but covered, like
the rest of the body, with long black hairs
<a href="#f493.png">(fig. 493)</a>. Some individuals have a
few light gray spots in pairs on the
abdomen. The shape
of the cephalothorax
and abdomen are like
<i>Amaurobius sylvestris</i>,
and the legs are
of the same proportional
length and
stouter. The palpi
of the female have the tibia and tarsus a little thickened. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
metatarsus of the fourth legs has the calamistrum more distinct
than in others of the family, and the metatarsus appears thicker
up and down than it is sidewise. The male has the legs longer,
particularly the first pair, of which the tibia and metatarsus are
more elongated than the other joints, and have many small
spines on the under side. The male palpi have the tarsus
large and round, supported by a wide and very complicated
tibia. It lives under stones in the hottest and dryest places.</p>

<p><b>Uloborus plumipes.</b>&mdash;Uloborus makes a round web, like those
of the Epeirid&aelig;, and when hanging in it resembles a Tetragnatha.
The adult female is about a quarter of an inch long,
and narrow like Tetragnatha. The cephalothorax is low in
front and extends forward, in the middle, beyond the mandibles,
and the back part is widened and swelled up on each side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
where the abdomen extends over it <a href="#f494.png">(fig. 494)</a>. The abdomen
is slightly notched in front and covers the cephalothorax a
quarter of its length. The abdomen is widest and thickest in
the front third and has there a pair of humps. The eyes are
in two rows, those of the upper
row largest and on the top of
the head, with the lateral pair
farthest back. The front row
are on the edge of the head
close to the mandibles. The
first pair of legs is the longest
and is twice as long as the
second. It has at the end of
the tibia a brush of long coarse
hairs. The colors are various
shades of brown, from very
light to almost black. The
cephalothorax has a light middle
stripe. The legs have the
joints light in the middle and
black at the ends, except the
first leg, which sometimes has
the tarsus and metatarsus
white, and the rest of the leg
dark brown. The fourth metatarsus
is curved in on the outer
side, where the calamistrum is
placed. The male is smaller
than the female, the legs are longer, the abdomen is smaller
and less distinctly humped, the first legs do not have the
brushes on the tibia, and the fourth legs do not have the calamistrum.
The webs resemble those of Epeira and Tetragnatha,
and are horizontal or inclined. They are often left unfinished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
with several turns of the wide temporary spiral still in them
<a href="#f495.jpg">(fig.495).</a> Sometimes there are zigzag lines of loose silk across
the center or in a middle spiral,
and when the eggs are laid the
long cocoons are fastened in a
line of silk across the web <a href="#f497.png">(fig. 497)</a>. When this is done the
center of the radii of the web
is usually at the upper part,
instead of in the middle, and
the whole web is one-sided.
It is found all over the country,
usually in shady woods,
in bushes, or in the lower
branches of trees, especially
in the lower dead
branches of pines.</p>

<p><b>Hyptiotes cavatus.</b>&mdash;This peculiar spider resembles
in shape and color the end of one of the
dead pine branches among which it
lives. It is a sixth of an inch long.
The cephalothorax is as wide as long,
highest in the middle, and hollowed
behind under the abdomen. The abdomen
is oval, thickest behind, and flattened
in front, and has on the back
four pairs of slight elevations, on which
are a few stiff hairs <a href="#f498-9.png">(fig. 498)</a>. The
legs are short and thickest in the middle,
tapering toward the claws. The
hind metatarsi are curved in at the
calamistrum <a href="#f498-9.png">(fig. 499)</a>. The eyes are arranged as in Uloborus,
but are farther apart and farther back on the cephalothorax.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
The male is half as large as the female, the abdomen smaller,
and the humps lower.</p>

</div>

<p>The web <a href="#f500.jpg">(fig. 500)</a> consists of four rays crossed by a dozen
or more threads. The point where the rays meet is attached
to a thread which extends to the spider's roost, usually the end
of a twig. Here it holds on by the hind feet and draws the
thread tight with the fore feet. When an insect strikes the
web the spider lets go with the hind feet and is jerked forward
by the contraction of the web, and slides along toward its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
center, where it finds the prey and takes it out of the web to its
perch. The making of this web has been described by Wilder
in the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i> in 1875. The cross threads are
made separately, beginning with the longest. They are begun
on the upper ray, the spider walking toward
the center, combing out the threads with its
hind legs, until it reaches a point where it
can cross to the next. It is found all over
the country, usually in the pine woods.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 501.</span> Filistata hibernalis,

</div>

<p><b>Filistata hibernalis.</b>&mdash;One of the most common
house spiders in the southern states,
making webs in corners and on walls and
fences <a href="#f501.png">(fig. 501)</a>. The body is about half
an inch long, but the legs are so long and
stout that it appears much larger. The
first leg, which is the longest, is about twice
the length of the body. The palpi are as
long as the cephalothorax and thicker than
in most spiders. The maxill&aelig; are inclined
toward each other so that they meet in
front of the labium. The cephalothorax
is flat and narrowed in front between the
palpi, and the mandibles are small. The
eyes are in one group, close together.
The color is dark gray, without any markings,
and the whole body is covered with
fine short hairs. The calamistrum is very
short, and near the base of the fourth metatarsus,
where it can easily be seen. The
web is like that of Dictyna, radiating irregularly from the spider's
hiding place, and when this is on a flat wall forms sometimes
a circle a foot or more in diameter, which becomes filled with
dust and is enlarged and thickened as the spider grows.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
